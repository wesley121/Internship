0,5,This is the best laptop in this range.I recieved late delivery due to big billion sale but the waiting was worth it. I played The Witcher 3 and Far Cry 4 in ULTRA graphics and it was running super smooth without any lag. So for gaming its a Beast no doubt. After 2 days I was getting charging issue and the charging was very slow so I contacted HP support via whatsapp and they told me to update the BIOS and after updating it was back to super fast charging and even the system was running faster...
1,5,Good product as used of now.... Everything is good and also SSD slot is given for upgradation.... Only keys of Keyboard are not looking as reliable as other basic HP laptops....it has been a month now... I will use it for three months again and will update my review.....
2,5,AWESOME LAPTOP. It supports many high spec games like gta 5. Super quality. I liked it very much
3,4,"For that price... it's exceptionally good. Played Far Cry 4 at Ultra Graphics 1080p.. was super smooth. So was GTA V, Just Cause 4. So you can do pretty decent gaming. General PC performance is good. Photoshop 2020 (June) works perfectly and also other Adobe products. Display is super cool too. So yeah, a good system overall for that price."
4,4,"RAM upgrade is must do because the useable RAM is only 6GB, Ryzen 5 3550H is a great processor however eats up 2GB RAM in system, Due to that Heavy games like GTA 5 stutter, The FPS while gaming is good however stuttering happens when games doesn‚Äôt get enough RAM, Due to which I have to spend another 3.5K to put a 2nd 8GB ram stick. Rest all Is good Display is crisp Battey is good for gaming laptop anyway to play games chargers needs to be plugged in, Although the 5400 RPM HDD is quite slow m..."
5,5,It's good gameing laptop in this price Display is good battery backup is good And I like keyboard üòÅüëå
6,4,Best laptop in this price range... Believe me if you are willing to buy this laptop don't hesitate just go Nd buy it !! Booting takes 22 sec... If you want more faster then I will recommend you to go for ssd variant... Speed of HDD is not that slow people are reviewing aboveüôÑ... Nd wait wait wait people are also saying above ram is the problem only given 6 GB so every device have some pre installed software so non of the brand will provide u 8 out of 8 gbs ü§¶‚ôÇÔ∏è...there is no problem with the...
7,4,"The AMD APU is a disappointment. If you guys don't know, the amd integrated graphics will reserve 2gb of your ram so you are left with 6gb instead of 8. HP has also locked their bios so we can't change vram settings either. It is what it is, I'll recommend that you should go for an Intel cpu if you can bcz amd might be cheaper but they will eat your hardware even though you are not using it at all so it's a waste of 1/4 of ram you paid for. Other than that Gtx1650 is a beast and ryzen 5 will ..."
8,5,"Its an absolute beast if u know what are the necessary steps to follow after completing the installation of your laptop...  Make sure you update all the drivers and specifically windows bios and nvidia drivers, because it enhances the performance very much , i myself have felt the same ...Just download a software called driver booster which is free and a great soft indeed it scans for all available driver updates and installs them , also it has a game turbo power option which releases some ra..."
9,4,Okay so ive been using this laptop since a few days/weeks now and i really like it 1. The display is good 2. The Laptop runs smoothly 3. Upgradable which is a big pro 4. Great sound quality 5. beautiful build 6. Games work nicely Cons 1. A little bit slow but that can be upgraded using a ram and ssd 2. I play fortnite and rocket league on it and they run smoothly but sometimes theres a frame drop which again can be solved by ssd and ram  Overall i would really say this is a great laptop
10,5,This is my 2nd laptop and ti be true i like it preety much. The booting speed is good and can be more if you install ssd in it.  Overall look wise it's awesome üëåüòç.  I played Apex legend in low graphic settings and it runs smoothly  The lappy can become a beast if you upgrade the ssd and ram ‚úåÔ∏è An additional of around 5k to 9k can be done to reach it's maximum potential. I'm happy with it üòä
11,3,"U'll need some upgrades  Ram needs to be extended, out of 8 gb some ram is always dedicated as shared memory for GPU, that is vega 8 (Not the main dedicated gpu).  Better to upgrade with a sdd at least for the os drive.  Not a beast for gaming but if upgraded can provide decent gaming experience. Don't expect good gaming or intense gpu performance on battery at this budget. Batteries for gaming laptop are not ment to provide you backup for long.  Got it at 44k, I think can't buy any thing bet..."
12,4,"The true potential of this thing is unleashed when it's plugged in. Don't even bother to game on this thing on battery only. Battery backup about 5 Hrs on normal uses like browsing, video streaming etc with both wifi and Bluetooth ON.  2GB out of the 8GB RAM is reserved for Vega 8 which is a real bummer. So another RAM of 8GB 2400 MHz is recommended at slot 2.  Pair it with an SSD ( ofcourse nvme recommend ) and feel the difference.  Be sure to download GeForce Experience.  Update all the dr..."
13,4,"For the peoples who R going to buy R they buyed this Product. U will Face all this Problems 1) Performance of the laptop is so slow 2) Booting time takes 40 sec coz of HDD 3)When u will play Heavy games like Gta 5 of pubg it will lag like A hell 4) Apps opening and closing time is soo slow and Feels like the laptop is lagging and performing Very slow. 5) Whenever u will game on It, The laptop will automatically Get lock and Restart.  Okay Now SolUTion For all of This -  1) Update ur Laptop to..."
14,5,This review is after using this laptop for 6 months. Display:10/10 Performance:10/10 Battery:8/10 No heating issues No fan noise while normal usage Suggestions: 1.try to add extra 8 gb ram.because amd integrated graphic card uses 2gb of ram and available ram is only 6gb. 2.try to add 500gb ssd and move your os to ssd. Then you laptop enters into beast mode  Overall great laptop with amazing specs. Blindly go for it.
15,5,"This is an initial impression review. The battery life, display and design are above par. Gaming experience is terrific with a good, strong card inside. The issue might be the 2GB RAM reseved by RX Vega which is the inbuilt mobile gpu of Ryzen. All in all, a good package and a great value for money. My suggestion would be to install an ssd and an additional 8 GB RAM in the near future to get the most out of the product. Note : Disappointed by flipkart for not putting in bubble wrap in the pa..."
16,5,greate deal for the price to performance ratio. for gaming it is good but only one problem it heats up quickly so for better you should keep it on cool surface for gaming . Other things are exellent. 'I loved the experience
17,5,Product is excellent but battery is draining is lot faster than I expected but it is above average. Overall product is good and I think you also get what you paid for. I am happy with laptop.
18,1,"Sorry, after 2 months of buying now....I am thinking why I bought this laptop ....I recommend don't buy you can go with intel instead of ryzen ...I bought it for coding and designing purpose but yet I haven't installed such softwares ...still it is getting hang while watching yt on it ... just like our Android get if memory gets full ...and also some time sentence of some part getting on screen adruptly ....design and display of lappi is excellent but had performence ...."
19,4,Good product performance really awsome and powerful battery life...üòáüòáüòç.. I like it very much
20,4,It is having a wonderful build design ? Build quality is really good Bcoz of not having ssd it's not that fast in opening files apps and softwares It doesn't gets too much heat Overall satisfied with the product
21,5,"Overall this is best buy in this price range. Only issue I found that it has 5.9 gigs of Usuable ram out of 8 gigs because of integrated amd graphics. It gives approximately 40 to 60 fps in high end games like watch dogs 2, gta v, Witcher 3 at high settings. Battery is decent, display quality is good....."
22,5,It is a bit slow.... If you want faster experience install ssd in it. It has SSD slot or you can go for SSD variant.Other than this all are woking good. I think this may not be a big problem. I loved it.... The gaming experience is so nice...overall performance is good..
23,4,"The laptop in short is a beast.For peaple owning a laptop for the first time,it would be bliss.It has many flaws(with HDD).But for those who are willing to take care of their laptop,it will work like a charm. Overall,I would say just to go for it."
24,4,It's small...Design good...Clarity awesome....Performance is good after 1 week use...Battery charges fast and stands nearly 6 hours for normal use ...One minor problem when it's charging we can't use the mouse touch pad smoothly...It's jumping and lagging....Better use separate mouse like i do...Just cause 3 plays very smoothly...Only 6 gb ram we can use as a default... Over all its a good one ...
25,5,"Good packaging, right on time, gorgeous design and lovely performance, best buy for beginners"
26,4,Product is awesome I m fully satisfied with the product. Display quality is superb But the delivery experience was not so good took almost 15 days to deliver the product..
27,5,Good Experience with this Product. For better more smoothness and for better experience upgrade add 256 GB SSD in it .
28,4,Nice product Battery mostly 4 to 5 hours But performance was very nice 4 star for late delivery otherwise product was very nice at this price Booting take normal time but its good in hdd Because sdd was fast comparable to hdd I think this is the drawback Company needs to modify ssd on this product
29,5,"Actually it's good ,no problem yet .just update your windows and it will became more fast. You can also add ssd and ram if you needed. Look wise it is great and battery charges very fast due to 150 watt charger.  Actually it's perfect if you add ssd and ram"
30,5,"I am using it for a day what i have noticed is it gets a little hot from the bottom right but it's manageable. The screen is beautiful, backlit keyboard makes it total worth the price. I bought it for 48,875 and it delivers really good specifications and quality. Overall it's a great product if you're getting it under 50k. If not then you should wait for some Flipkart sale."
31,5,"Excellent laptop for professional as well as gaming purpose. I am writing this review after 1 month of use. First when I got the product it was not the proper product as the OS was having some problem. But immediately hp service man have checked and cleared the problem. I am using this laptop for design purpose. I use to work with AutoCAD, CATIA, SOLIDWORKS, etc. These applications are running super smooth and speed in this laptop. However if you are using this kind of high end applications ..."
32,5,Performance was awesome .....it has Amd Rhyzen 5 3550H processor which has slightly lower base clock speed of 2.1 GHz but that works much better than Intel Core i5 9th gen and also neck to neck i5 10th gen....some said it was also better than i7 9th gen ....which I can even realise when it renders videos within minutes in DaVinci Resolve which is most renowned video editing software and heavy software in the industry...but that is only possible with an extra installation of M.2 Nvme SSD from...
33,5,"One of the best budget gaming laptop loved it üòò. Smooth performance, good graphics card but it would have been better if there were other colors of RGB lights on the keyboards and u cannot change the color of the keyboard lights. But good laptop beast performance."
34,4,"absolutely satisfied with the product. No ssd in this one but believe me it boots up in freaking 20 seconds. its just mind boggling. performance wise its descent handles my alll the tasks like a charm and it has got a good cooling system as well. fan not so loud so . if u r having a strict budget around 52k just go for this, spending little more and getting a hexa core proccesor model 1021ax would be wiser though. go for it u wont be dissapointed.  Edit: if u buy this one here after do not uo..."
35,5,"Pictures don't do justice.. Product is awesome and built quality is too good. Looks premium. Upgrade to ssd for most of this beast.. Display is awesome. Backlit is good. Purple is better than >>>red, white.. I have used many of them... Battery is 4 hours.. Overall it's a beast under 50k..  If u are getting it under 55k go for it..  Out of 8 gb ram 6 gb ram is what we get.."
36,4,Best at this price range only compromising thing is its ram but 6 gb ram also handle many AAA titles with ease but you may notice some of very high end titles sttuter like GTA 5 because of ram if you upgrade your ram to 12 gb or 16 gb then you will get the real performance of this lappy ....no frame drops after upgrading and handle 70% new games with 60fps ij high setting .....
37,4,Look perfect üíï Display is nice Sound quality is superb üíï Performance :- A little bit laggy... But if you upgrade with ssd then it gives you a good performance .. 5 day genuine review
38,4,Overall This Laptop Is Great But Someone Who Want Something Perfect I inform You That For Ame Lovers Its gReat thing as 4gb graphics and 8 gb ram is spectacular on the other hand battery drains quickly when you play games its important to plug in charger while playing  Screen size is small compare to others but its budget friendly so no offense  Need ssd for the fast startup and game lags due to it when power supply is not connected  I lost my battery sign on the taskbar so if anyone know how...
39,4,"Ok, so I have a lot to say. First of all, I ordered this laptop for my sister on 7th Nov. My father purchased it and it was fast delivered. Coming to packaging. Flipkart terrible packaging from the outermost. When we first unboxed it the hp package was perfect in condition. The laptop was fresh as anticipated. It was perfectly sealed. Ok now coming to the product. I'll say it directly. Pros Display-15.6 perfect if you want a big screen and got bored of a 14 inch one Processor-a ryzen 5 3550h..."
40,5,Amazing Laptop Loved it I upgraded the 256gb Western Digital Nvme SSD into it which make it's performance next level Booting time reduced from 40 seconds to 18 seconds. Recommended to install ssd to get real performance
41,5,"Very Good Packaging. Product safely kept. Received the product in good condition. Clean Stuff. Only problem is the RAM, 6GB is only usable out of 8GB"
42,5,I ordered this laptop a month ago and I really love it So this review is for those who aren't sure if it's worth it well to be honest it has a average battery in terms of me rating it But it is really fast and the screen is really good Design wise and performance is really good It comes with a ryzen 5 processor and gtx 1650 Graphics card Which is really great Especially for gaming U can play fortnite above 60 fps and 120 fps with no problem Go for it it's really worth it The only is...
43,4,"I bought this laptop for a balance routine like moderate gaming and normal work, and i have no complaints. The battery backup is really good of around 4hrs 30min to 5 hrs. The keyboard is well lit and you have no problem seeing the buttons even in dark room conditions. Ive been using this for 3 months now and I HAVE NO ISSUES with it. Do keep in mind that this comes with the TRIAL version of Microsoft Office and not the full version. It comes with McAfee antivirus which does a really good j..."
44,5,Very nice laptop for students and office work better that Asus and Acer We can play game at High settings to get 60fps Battery is very nice and laptop charges in 30-60 min Display is fantastic
45,4,"This is a decent gaming laptop, not recommended for high end gamers. However for casual gamers it's a nice option and performance is also good."
46,4,This Laptop has a HDD which is really slow at booting...i would recommend you to buy a M.2 NVME SSD for Faster boot time and great performance...and also add up an 8GB ddr4 RAM for great performance
47,5,"I have been using this for a week now. Short answer, just go for it, the best non chinese laptop under this price segment. I brought it for 48k. I have seen most of the reviews saying performance is not great. First things first you have to plug in while you are gaming otherwise you won't be getting the peak performance or just set battery to best performance while you are not plugged in.  Boot time with HDD: Again I have seen many reviews saying it takes around 1 and half minute to boot ..."
48,5,One of tha Best laptop for Gaming and also for office work  Pros... Best performance Best display Best Sound Best design Best battery backup Beautiful backlit keyboard Trust of HP service  Put ssd and increase ram yourself.. Then this laptop will be Beast performance.  Cons.... Average webcam Boot time max 30sec... Only 5.9gb Ram available

50,4,"I am satisfied with it at this price.Smooth performance even without ssd , backlight is just awesome I loved it.this is best for overall performance wheather you want to play game ,do editing , everything you can do smoothly.must buy it."
51,5,Awesome Product. Really fast and reliable. Haven't played any games yet but it pretty solid with multi tasking. Takes some time to start up the first time but then later its fine. I preferred Ryzen 5 over intel because of performance and it truly delivers that performance.
52,5,At this prize Intel is giving best laptops. But for 50k ryzen 5 3550h quad core is less At the prize of 45k other laptop is giving ryzen 5 hexa core
53,4,Overall I like the laptop and perferably perfer this one.  Pros: 1. Speaker quality is good 2. LED quality is good and great display 3. Keybord is nice 4. Battery back is nice upto 3 hours without games. 5. Laptop build quality is nice. 6. Cooling is very well. 7. Camera quality is quiet well. 8. Processor is at their best  Cons: 1. There should be an SSD in place of HDD ( In this price tag ). 2. There is lagging problem while playing games on battery mode.
54,4,I bought this laptop far a week now.. it was soo cool and amazing performance for this price range.The only issue is with the booting time gets more time because of no ssd.. and the battery is pretty good for my usage..and for great performance there is a M.2 sad slot you can easy add ssd and run os on that ssd it will boot fast and fast processing üî•.. Overall the laptop is beast because of Nividia GTX 1650 graphics üî•üî•..go for it don't hesitate to buy it's a beast for this price range and...
55,4,I write this review after using 10 days Design of laptop is excellent Especially display I loved it Battery is disappointing me Except battery all else fine If you are student then go for it Overall this is my first laptop so I love it One more thing performance is bit slow due to hdd If you want to play gt5 then you add ssd this boot your performance
56,2,"This review is after using for 1 week after installing all the updates and updating BIOS. This is a mediocre laptop. It just gets the work done. If you are purchasing this laptop, better get the SSD version or better get a SSD and upgrade RAM. The HDD version is really slow to boot up and takes 2-3 minutes after startup to function without stuttering. The initial 2-3 minutes after startup is really painful to use. My 2012 Dell laptop with HDD boots faster and can get to functioning properly ..."
57,5,"The only thing that I noticed is that it takes a little time to boot up. I have had used Lenovo before, beside being old it boots even taster than HP. Other than this I like all about it, when it gets little hot the two fans kicks in which makes me feel that I have a powerful machine. If you have more budget, then I would suggest you to go for Asus ROG. Which is too of the line product."
58,5,Good laptop with quite good display and features. Performance wise the processing is little slower than expected. Good buy at this price. Games run with good speed and efficiency.
59,3,"The design and the user experience is best in class. But, it is quite slow. Even simple activities take longer time to respond. Also, would have been great if it had a Touch screen instead of a regular screen. Overall, I am happy except for these issues."
60,4,"The System is quite good in terms of processing power. The only problem is HDD, it takes ages to load anything. Be it booting or starting any heavy app. It takes a lot of time to run apps and to boot up. The same problem is true for most laptops with HDD as primary storage.  To overcome the long wait in boot time. I use the hibernate option provided by windows instead of shutdown. Hibernate keeps all your apps running and cuts of the power to the system. So the next time you turn it on, it's ..."
61,5,Awsome laptop. Only battery backup is a little lower but charges faster and windows 10 is genuine it is still awsome laptop.
62,5,"This is my first higher price product that I bought from Flipkart. The seller was PETILANTE ONLINE. I was very much satisfied with overall everything. I literally have zero complaints. The package and the delivery was all perfect and genuine. Coming to the laptop, it's the BEST machine if you're looking for a great gaming and also for other miscellaneous purposes. I never thought that online shopping would be a bliss. Thank you, Flipkart."
63,4,"-Laptop looks great. -Display is awesome. -Those backlits are awesome man. We feel like watching the backlits turn-on the whole day. -Battery is below average to be frank. I get hardly 2:30 hrs backup. -Speakers are good, but not the best in this price rang e and especially when they mention B & Bo audio system, I expected more from it. -As it has only HDD, it's not that fast, it gets stuck at times but still manageable. -Graphics is good. I played Asphalt 9 legends.  Verdict: Go for it!üëç"
64,5,"First thing first Do not rush for games, do windows updates first Updates will take time even after having a good internet connection. Once updates are done, it will completely turns into beast.

66,3,"Battery is pathetic, like I was getting free electricity in Delhi due to limited consumption, but this laptop sure gonna hike my electricity usage.  Laptop lags a bit , atleast 128 GB SSD should be given , and yes ram needs to get upgraded too , in order to have good performance.  Rest okayish product. For average usage."
67,4,I am writing this review almost a month After I have started using the product. As per the price it is an Ok quality of product. You can expect this quality of product for a range of 50k to 55k. I have got it on 48k inclusive of offers. Pros : 1.Got a very productive and effecient build quality. 2. Backlight Keyboard 3. Great 15.6 Inch Display. 4. Graphics card and Support 5.

69,5,pretty cool design the performance is really good the battery performance is good and it really charge very fast comparing to another laptops if you are seeing a laptop under 55k you can go for it
70,5,Good trending budget gaming configuration. HP has hit a jackpot in this category and it‚Äôs sales have seen a huge demand for the price point... more than Omen series. Can use it for Design softwares as well as heavy Gaming... serves well for both. AMD Ryzen series of processors wont disappoint you... trust me!
71,5,The laptop is just a beast. I loved the design of the laptop the speakers and the keys are the top quality. The battery of the laptop last well for normal usage for like 6 to 7 hours. I received the latest hp pavilion model the wifi is the best and it can connect to a wifi and a ethernet cable together at the same time you can enable this feature from the omen command center you can download it for free from the microsoft store the laptop performance is also good i am using this from last 10 ...
72,5,"Good laptop with being able to run most games... Due to hardisk ,the laptop is very slow.booting time takes much time...but if you add. Ssd and move is to ssd. Then this laptop will be fast to boot..comes with a dedicated graphics. To play AAA title games...Due to AMD processor Vega 8 uses 2gb ram so u only get around 6 GB to use..

It was damn slow and plastic felt very cheap, like for example, when you lift the laptop, you hear cracking noise throughout.  2 laptop;  First thing I did to uninstall the trail version antivirus as that made the laptop too slow.

78,5,Best laptop for this type of specifications in this affordable price. And also good for Music quality.Display is good for quality videos . Performance is not so good.
79,5,Excellent product super value for money I mean this is a all rounder though u get gtx 1650 ti in competition but then is jus about 5 % gap go with this upgrade ram and ssd and good to go
80,5,"Its been 2 weeks I am using the laptop, upgraded with 8 GB more RAM and it works like a charm, all the AAA titles of game runs smoothly on it - The game you name it and this beast will play it like charm, overall a great choice for official use also - For Work from home. To unlock the beast do upgrade with 8 GB ram and 240 GB SSD and it will run faster than any other laptop in this price range. Great value for money, Looks are awesome. Great choice."
81,5,excellent laptop with amazing looks and good price range. Just add a SSD to it and it's super fast.
82,4,"The hp pavilion gaming ryzen 5 laptop is a great option for a mix between business and gaming laptop. It has great design,good sound, great display.good battery and processor. The only downside is it doesn't come with a SSD which is a must for this laptop. It's a little slow without the SSD but since I had the SSD installed it's very fast. All in all a good buy at this price. Add 5k for SSD 500gb"
83,4,"Display and design are great hdd is slow i updated this ssd its very fast and battery is average but 150watt charges charges very quick, gaming performance while charger plugged is seamless i got it for RS.49240/- perfect deal im happy with it."
84,4,Design of the laptop is very good . Performance not that good because some high spec games like GTA 5 are lagging . Need to install a ssd and a 8 GB ram additional. But I think this is the best laptop in this price range as it offers Nvidia gtx 1650 . And also battery backup is also just ok not good .
85,4,This is best laptop for students. I really like keyboard and disin. Startup almost 10s. But super and amazing. Perfomance is specialy amazing. I konw ryzen is best than in intel.still i satisfied this product üòç
86,3,At first week the laptop was quite fast it's booting time was also less than 1 min. But after 1 month due to some windows 10 update booting tome went upto 4-5 minutes. And the laptop battery was also not too long for general purpose we can use it for 3-4 hours or sometimes even less. But I am happy with hp customer service because when my battery adapter failed to work they replaced it with new one. I could suggest you that instead of buying HDD you may buy 4gb 1050 graphic card with SSD. Whi...
87,3,I have been using this product for the last 10 days. So let me share my experience here.  -Its packing was great  -It has a decent screen.  -The backlight keyboard with violet color makes it quite attractive.  -speaker sound is good  -Battery backup is okay (even after using normal applications. Don't know if u play heavy games!!)  -webcam is great.  -this laptop is a bit slower & its booting time is more which makes it look like its lagging. It should be more faster as it has an AMD Ryzen 5 ...
88,2,Startup is very long  Battery is not good  Working speed also no good .  This is the worst experience in laptops I ever used .  I didn't use first 15 days due to some person reasons now till then my return period is over .  Please I strongly recommend don't buy this laptop
89,4,1)i liked it very much because of its design fabulus 2)dispaly was good and bright &veuvienig angles were also good at that price range 3)performace was excelent and it also come with 4gb nvidia gtx 1650 grafix card which can handle the heavy games &softwares easily 4)booting time is little bit late when compare with SSD laptop because it comes only with HDD the good thing is we can easily upgrade the storage with help of SSD up to 1TB 5)we can also upgrade RAM upto 16 gb and it comes with 8...
90,4,"Its takes a several minutes when its starting for first time. but after that it runs smoothly. Also the specification of RAM given here is 8 gb, yes its true.. but for daily(normal usage) you can use only 6 gb. Rest 2 gb is reserved. The best thing is The display and trackpad.  the thing which I didn't liked is that, it only has 2 usb ports which sometimes feels short when multiple devices needs to be connected."
91,1,"Don't ever buy this laptop , the description says it's a gaming laptop but it can't handle games like gta 5 and goes into hibernation mode within 5 minutes of the game and out of the 8gb ram only 5.9 gb is available and performance is not that slick , hence would advise anyone looking to buy this , avoid it and spend extra and get yourself a better laptop"
92,5,Highly Satisfied and value for money Laptop   7 months since I purchased this laptop and it works perfectly . Boot time was more since it has only HDD but when i installed SSD everything is just matter of seconds . Also upgraded Ram to 16 GB only I confirmed with HP service executive that the laptop Ram can be expanded to 32GB.   I suggest to confirm the Ram capacity with HP service center before upgrading the Ram
93,4,"the laptop is great, an excellent buy for students and gamers alike.  the cpu and gpu work great in gaming and video editing. display size and quality is excellent. the keyboard feels really tactile and good to use. one of the con i found about this laptop is out of the 8gb ram, only 6 gb ram is usable ( 2gb ram is reserved for the integrated graphics). so i reccomend adding another 8gb ram stick for the best performance."
94,4,Ok So first don't trust on my english i hope you people can understand.  I review this laptop after 1 month of use i purchase this laptop on 3rd December 2020 today is 3rd jan 2021.   Look wise product is awesome. looks you want in gaming laptops this laptop satisfy the looks  Lets talk about display and the display is to awesome do not worry about display. Performance wise : you got amd ryzen 5 with radeon vega graphics(for display) and gtx 1650 dedicated graphic card with 8 gigs of ram but...
95,5,07/09/20 today I got my laptop and it's design is fabulous looking too good. Really lite in weight display is descent for a hdd it is little bit slow but it has a nvme m.2 port for upgrading and a ddr4 extra ram slots so you can upgrade whenever you want to.best laptop for gaming and and work.ryzen processor really works well and that purple colour combinations is really eye catching
96,5,"A great laptop at this price segment with hp branding. I would suggest to go for ssd variant not with hdd one it takes around 15 -20 sec to work properly at time of boot. Battry is decent you can watch videos for 6-7 hrs i guess But dont expect gaming without charging  Conclusion- nice product if you want to do all work gaming , editing, coding and video watching"
97,3,The laptop itself is nice it can play most games at high graphics at 60fps i play total war troy which is a demanding game and it runs smoothly. The main problem arises when you start playing games like forza horizon 4 the game will run at 60fps ultra but due to very slow hdd and very low ram it will stutter. The laptop has 8gb of ram out of which 2.1 gb is hardware reserved for vega 8 graphics which itself is good and can handle most things on its own. After that the os will take futher 1-2 ...
98,4,"Besides all reviews i fell good after buying this laptop. But their i feel some lag in performance. I prefer you to go for ssd version or buy 256gb or 520 gb ssd for upgrade if you want to enjoy its full performance . Regarding to battery, it is a gaming laptop so thier battery quality is always low as they are build for playing games while charging for full performance.all total battery is better than expected. All total you can go with this laptop but later you have to buy ssd and ram for ..."
99,5,Very nice product must buy !!!!! *Performance is very nice.. *Battery backup up to 90min for gaming otherwise for small works 3-4hrs *Audio quality is good but not so loud. * Display also good even we can use in sunlight Over all nice product must by this.
100,3,Best Value And Discount From Flipkart.... But This Hp pavilion Ryzen 5 Gaming Laptop Not Good For Gaming Performance.... Please add some money and get better Version Of Ryzen And Graphics Cards.... Like GEOFORCE RTX
101,5,PEOPLE LISTEN.... MANY SAY IT'S SLOW AMD WASTE OF MONEY AND CREATE A RUCKUS IN THE BUYER'S MIND.... SEE... IT HAS SLOWER BOOTING TIME ONLY BECAUSE 5400 RPM HDD.... JUST CLONE THE OS TO A SSD...THATS IT... IT'S A PERFECT BEAST... AND THE HDD IS NOT AS DUMB AS PEOPLE SAY.... REMOVE MANY STARTUP PROGRAMS IN MSCONFIG AND ENABLE QUICK BOOT IN BIOS... MAXIMUM 25 SECS BOOT TIME AFTER THIS... MOSTLY 15 TO 18 SECS...... THE LAPPY IS A SEXY BEAST TO BEHOLD....

106,5,Laptop is really pretty first of all. I have played sekiro and mk 11 till now both are working on max. Only issue i am having is of ram the system gets overloaded very easily because of ram. Maybe if we just upgrade it all will be fine. Overall everything is working as expected.
107,4,Awesome

109,5,A pc like this comes in a lifetime!!!! Very Very happy to purchase this . My dream of gaming came true. Games like The Witcher 3:Wild Hunt and specially Grand Theft Auto V runs beautifully. Although latest high end games like Devil May Cry 5 (2019) takes quite a toll on the ram often causing the game to lag if played for longer duration so my recommendation is to play latest high end games for less duration about 2 hrs not more than that. Hope upgrading it will fix this issue otherwise everyt...

I have played rise of the tomb Raider, you get around 30-40fps on high settings.

122,5,Very nice product in this price range.

129,2,"So this rating is for the laptop which comes in original condition without ssd. Before ssd laptop was performing below average and HP bloatware was dragging the performance down. So I installed a new wd ssd and migrate os in that ssd. Now the performance is improved alot. Machine boots in 7 to 10 seconds, copying speed is 22mbs/sec. And I am happy.  Laptop body is fingerprint magnet.  Recommendation- if anyone wants to buy this product install ssd in it. You will be happy."
130,5,Value for money laptop good also good for programing and beast gaming performance üî•üî•
131,5,Perfect laptop under 55k
132,5,Let me tell a kutty story .. pay attention Listen to me...this laptop is just awesome naaüòÉ
133,3,1) Real daily boot time is 4 minutes atleast. Don't expect to boot in 1 minute. 2) lags a little while using from first day. Opening of apps is not that fast. 3) hdd used in it is of toshiba company. Hdd is not good its speed is slow. 4) comes with mcafee antivirus of only 1 month. 5) ADDITIONAL RAM AND SSD IS MUST in this laptop !!!

136,5,"I'm using this laptop since one week. I'm very satisfied with this product, nice design, performance, sound quality, a good choice for a budget multitasking Laptop, just felt a little slower without adding SSD. It Would be greater if it had a 7200 RPM HDD."
137,5,Nice product and nice luking
138,5,Today i have received the laptop..Thanks for flipkart team.. and we will write review the laptop workings after 15 days

For gaming- working smoothly  Just one suggestion - those who are facing issue in battery and performance lag, pls update the window completely and while updating don't use laptop. Initially it will take 4 to 5 hours to update. Then u use the üíª, u can see the difference.  Overall: 1. Build quality is very nice 2. ..."
141,5,Great performance but there is need to add a SSD for boost in the performance.Got the order after a delay than expected delivery date but product wasn't damaged.Product was intact.Overall nice future proof product.
142,1,"Writing this review after 6 month of usage, after updating latest update of nvidia amd and software update boot time it quite okay performance is the worst thing in this laptop games frequently crash and hangs a lot worst experience ever."
143,5,Just wow! üòç
144,4,Over all Good.... Windows opening speed is low.. may be due to no SSD Thanks fr all trial version software development
145,4,"It's a good laptop you can play games in medium or low settings it can give you around 60 fps,but don't expect High quality gaming with High frame rate,Also if you upgrade the ram and add ssd to it you can increase its performance,the display quality and viewing angles are also good, overall it's a good laptop for its price"
146,2,Booting is very very slow
147,5,Love it.
148,5,a personal suggestion extend ram with one more 8 gb stick otherwise gta V lags alot
149,5,Beast pc ever it can handle any game buy it if you are a student or gamer but not suitable for commercial use because battery life is soooo bad about 2 hrs only booting time is 22 sec if want fast then go for ssd version best pc
150,4,It's a handy laptop for both performance and style. I have been using for a month now and I have zero issues with any of the spec or nuances around the laptop. Ryzen's quad core sure helps keep cpu usage below 50% even during hard core coding moments while I have 20+ tabs open chrome 2-3 heavy developer softwares running simultaneously and Spotify plays music. I have not played games with it so I'm not in a position to talk about the gaming aspects of the laptop.
151,5,Best laptop at this prize range..
152,5,Fully Satisfied ü§©ü§©ü§©
153,3,Good product but delay in delivery
154,1,"Does anyone except dead slow performance with 8GB RAM & 5 Quad Core?. It loads like a Sloth , Booting time, Application Opening time, Button responses are worst. It's about week & half I purchased this laptop. I will review back after a month again. Lets see! 16-Aug-2020: Dead slow, Worst performance sofar!"
155,4,The start up time seem to be a bit higher than usual where as the specs should be reducing the time to start. Initially I got a start up time of 20-25 sec to Login Screen .. which was really good. however it seems to be a bit slow now a days. Unsure of the reasons. Battery back is good. Display is beautiful. Very less heating issue. Gaming is good. Haven't done extensive gaming though. In-Built apps helps a lot.
156,4,Nice product..
157,5,Gaming experience is absolutely amazing...
158,4,"Good laptop, but to take full advantage of this you definitely need to upgrade both SSD to make it faster since it is very slow loading applications and even booting and upgrade RAM, coz when I play games on this laptop it stutters a lot since only 5.9gb ram is available. Other than that display, keyboard n track pad are good. I didn't find any worry some heating issues while doing intensive works which is good. Looks premium but it is made full of plastic and one thing I don't like is that p..."
159,5,It's awesome...
160,5,VERY AWESOME LAPTOP..  BEST LAPTOP IN THIS RANGE  VERY GOOD IN PERFORMANCE
161,4,Preformance + premium looks üíØ Go for it
162,1,Only purchase it if you're ready to spend at least 5-6k more on adding additional RAM and SSD. Without SSD it's dead slow. And you'll need additional RAM to play games as AMD keeps 2.1 gb RAM reserved so you get only 5.8 GB RAM available which is too low.
163,4,Nice laptop.
164,5,It's all things is good but battery backup is written there 5 hours but it not it's battery backup is is only 3 and half hours
165,5,Its awesome laptop
166,3,"The laptop is slow! Really really slow. And this, without any new applications installed. Disappointing performance."
167,5,Just spend 5-7k extra to upgrade RAM and SSD and see your dreams come true
168,5,Asowm
169,3,"Using this laptop for a week. Here are some things I noticed. Positive points:  Display is value for the money. Design is great, body looks awesome. After effects and GTA V runs like charms.  I do graphic design and rendering using Blender and it works fine I have no complains so far   Negative points: Cyberpunk lags so I had to uninstall. Problem in loading large Blender files Lag issues in using big graphic intensive software. Startup takes time, maybe buy an SSD version.  Not sure..."
170,4,Performance is okay. Sound quality is superb. Display is good. The main disappointment is battery. Battery is draining fast
171,5,So far So goood!!!üî•üî•üì£
172,5,Very good product and less price
173,4,Overall the laptop is good but after using it for 5 days the booting time is very slow but the games run good I would suggest you to go for extra 8gb ram and 250gb ssd.
174,5,Before time delivery. Awesome product peformance.goos build quality. Nice sound . Best display..
175,4,Good laptop but thinking to add ssd
176,5,Thanks for this product... i am very satisfied with this... i am in love with HP‚ù§ Design and Looks is elegant... AMD ryzen is always cool... Thanks!
177,4,Everything is good about the Laptop. Design is okay.. Performance wise..it is good. Since it is a gaming laptop ..it's should have something special that makes this laptop different from others.

179,5,Not first as I thick . But nice in 55 k
180,4,I am satisfied with the product but it didn't reach my expectations
181,1,One of the least efficient thing I have bought from. Flipkart no doubt packaging is quite good But performance of laptop. Is mil. It's boot time is 3-4 times future We have to wait for 2-3 mins for google chrome or microsoft edge to start I think this is not gaming laptop this is waiting laptop all time just we have to. Go on waiting

185,4,"4 star because i got damaged product first time . and the replacement policy was bit annoying. Otherwise laptoop is good , best laptop in this price range .And yeah it's battery backup is sort of weak too."
186,1,"The worst investment done by me till date, the product is not at all upto the mark. It is said to be gaming laptop but it has problem of freezing you can't do work as well. Its my worst experience till now in all the laptop i have been used. And if you are going to buy laptop please don't buy ryzen go for another processor."
187,5,Amazing
188,4,Excellent Performance....üî•
189,1,This laptop is too too slow from 1st day.
190,4,Performance was improved after the updates. Battery is good Edges are sharp and it got me a few times. Not a problem while typing. Display is good Keyboard is single color with two brightness modes and off.

192,4,As flipkart assured all the specs were very well integrated.
193,4,Fast delivery Excellent laptop
194,1,The battery gets drained within 1hour and it takes upto 3hours to get full charge.
195,5,"I using since august 2020, awesome laptop..  I daily use for about 10 12 hours continue, no heating problem  Battery backup is about 5 hr on 5% of screen brightness with earphones  Thank-you HP for this awesome beast"
196,3,It's take to much time to start and shut down it's with out SSD so windows is so slow
197,3,Just for normal works.....old rated product
198,5,I recommend to every budget Gamer this was the best option for this price point......
199,5,Everything is good and worth for the price But within four five days the inbuilt mouse gave up Everything runs smoothly but yeah the mouse sucks
200,4,It's look is awesome working good but a little slow as it is HDD. Will update about it performance later.
201,5,SETISFIED IN THIS PRISE :-)
202,1,Worst product ever and i had a worst very bad experience ordering with flipkart the customer care is not helpfull . No one ever listens to the customer
203,5,best laptop for graphic designing and gaming thanks flipkart
204,4,I got this for 45.5k using card offer best in that price.add SSD 256gb 3.5k and the laptop is beast
205,5,Working great. No lag. Quality good
206,5,"I was sceptical before buying, but I received a brand new stock, Jan 2021 in February itself. The packing itself was untouched from factory. We bought two, and I asked my daughter about the performance, she gave everything 5 stars and for battery 4 stars. Overall we are happy about the purchase after using it for over a month."
207,5,You should go for nvme ssd hardware or u can upgrade this then it would be beast
208,4,Looks great n after use of some time I add my review
209,5,It was fantabulous inthis price range.The display and sound quality of this laptop is top-notch but little bit slow down which is negligible.Good battery backup and backlit keyboard.Iam happy with this.
210,4,Good For the decent Gaming And other user stuff...But cannot run highEnd Games smoothly without The Frame drops...unless You upgrade The Ram.
211,5,Awesome product
212,5,Awesome laptop
213,5,After ssd it is a beast goo for it
214,5,Mind blowing lappy.... I highly recommend just go for it....
215,5,Better to put SSD in it
216,4,"At first it didn't go well,Then I put an SSD, now it's going wellüòä"
217,4,"After 1 week of use my impression:  Perfomence: Laptop is slow compared to others devices at this range, maybe performance will be better after installation of ssd and increasing ram.  Battery: battery backup is descend. I will fully review this after a month or so.  Design: Design is really impressing.  Keyboard & trackpad: keyboard quality is good but trackpad is descend.  I will cover full review after a month or so."
218,4,HDD doesn't help. It's slow than slowest. Upgraded with SSD and it became lightning fast. Make the SSD primary drive with OS installation. HDD can be back up one
219,5,"Good build quality Apart from HDD, everything is great. User can purchase SSD or buy SSD variant for more speed."
220,5,"It's a really great product, I would say go for it and it is also upgradable, so u can buy it if you want a lap for 4-5 years.  Till 1TB SSD can be installed And also extra 8GB ram can be installed (In total 16 GB)."
221,5,Laptop is superb.....ü§ûüî•ü§ô All laptop's give battery backup upto 3-4hrs. That laptop also gives same battery backup. I liked it's thermal cooling system. As the temperature increases the fan spped is increase. Cooling system is superbüî•üî• Design and overall other things are also good.
222,5,Good economical product
223,4,It's good.
224,4,An awesome budget gaming laptop having a good processor but HDD makes its quite slow but all over its Excellent
225,3,"I donnow it takes 2.1 minutes to start only some times, i feel somehere d system is slow, may be bcz of No SSD, but still this shouldn't be this much slow, even opening photos, opening windows takes around 10 seconds some times even 15 seconds, and multi task also i feel not too fast, lets see after two days hw it works Even the Adobe softwares response is also satisfactory, not completely satisfied"
226,5,"Best laptop in this range Got at 46k only. Played Valorant without facing any problem Need to add SSD for rough usage, otherwise no problem in normal use with HDD."
227,5,I HAVE A PROBLEM ABOUT THIS LAPTOP NOT ABOUT THIS LAPTOP BUT ABOUT FLIPKART SERVICES FIRSTLY FLIPKART GIVES ME SURITY ABOUT I WILL GOT MY LAPTOP AT 18 OCT AND IT TAKES ONE MORE EXTRA DAY AND IT ARRIVES ON 20 OKAY THATS NOT A PROBLEM THE PROBLEM IS MY LAPTOP IS ALREDY SETUPED AND WINDOWS IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND ONE USER ACCOUNT IS CREATED ON IT AND SECURITY SOFTWARE IS ALSO INSTALLED ON IT AND FOR CONNECTIVETY THEY ALSO ATTACHED JBL SPEAKER AND MANY MORE AND AND I CHEACKED LAST TIME WHEN ...
228,2,"Performance is average, and the gaming performance too is not so good. I tried to install gta 5 and ith lags like hell even at low settings. The battery backup is also so poor."
229,5,I'm in love with this laptop üíúüíúüíú
230,5,Amazing laptop and a pure beast at this price segment. No lag or heating issues and battery lasts easily for 4 hours on normal usage. Got it within a day and far above my expectations. Just add an m2 SSD and additional 8 GB 2400 MHz RAM and it'll be the best thing ever.
231,3,It was good but sometimes apps like blender and fusion 360 are not responding I don't know exactly what the problem is but I downloaded the apps with lisence but why the are not responding nad battery backup is not up to the mark I think it should be get more backup and charging speed is okay..
232,5,Just awsoom Looks 10/10 Performance best Sound awesome Just love with pavilion
233,4,Pros: Performance is really good Excellent configuration for the given price  Cons: Poor build quality No pre-installed MS office Battery last long for max of 5hrs unlike hp is claiming like 8hrs
234,3,Worst customer care experience. Even after 6 days of my complaint HP was even unable to find what causes the problem and I am still waiting for an explanation from them.
235,5,The laptop is an absolutely power package for the given price range and runs most games at a decent pace . Gta v has encountered a frame rate lag but runs almost smooth when service priority set high and framerate at 40fps. The absence of an ssd and an higher ram is an disappointment but the upgradable slots are a counter to the issue with an additional expense of 10grand will make up for an 1tb ssd with another 8gb ram . Overall very satisfied with product
236,5,Nice to handle
237,4,This could have ssd card for faster operation and not having disc drive.
238,4,"Only 2 usb slots provided which is disappointing, battery backup is just ok sustainable not that great. Display is ok doesn't have a full HD vibe. Overall a good one."
239,3,Low battery backup upto 3.5hrs for normal usage
240,4,Laptop is overall value for money and u can play GTA V like games in very high settings. The main problem Im facing is its performance issue.but after installing SSD and Ram this laptop is working very smoothly u won‚Äôt regret after buying it. And finally the Thermals of the laptop @ max temp during GTA V was 84 degree and that is quite good so this laptop is very in thermals also u can play 4-5 hours continuously. üëç
241,4,It an good machine but one must add SSD before or after using it(without SSD it pretty much slow) SSD slot is available(M.2)
242,5,Great quality and good looking device.
243,5,Its amazing laptop with 55k budget..... Awesome experience with gaming..... Battery backup is good..
244,4,Everything is okay but sime times it got slowness as 2 GB RAM out of 8 GB RAM is already locked by system....just getting 20 to 30 seconds hanging
245,5,Best in price but must add SSD
246,5,Must buy product and amazing gaming beast at this price
247,3,Awesome product.
248,5,Nice one but require ssd
249,5,"product is so good just go for it. battery is good. display is awesome. graphics also awesome. it hangs some times , but after the windows update it is awesome. best laptop at this price"
250,3,Not bad
251,5,Perfect device in this price range
252,1,"Don't even think to play warzone with this laptop, it just hangs up and you'll be taking an year to come back to home screen."
253,5,HP IS GREAT FOR LAPTOP AND PRINTER
254,4,Totally good.. U always need charger for avoid lag and battery draining while playing gta 5 and other high games.. Also u need to add ssd. For better perfomence.. 8gb ram. But 5gb available.. Design and backlit is very good... Best value in money..

Looking awesome... battery life have to improve...logo on the back of lapy is very good.... key travel of keyboard is better...under 50 Thousand this is awesome gamming laptot...but you have to install SSD...
260,4,Everything is good but they are not giving SSD.. Almost all companies are giving SSD in this price..
261,5,"I have used this laptop for more than one month and have not faced a single issue in it..I have played gta 5, did video editing in premiere pro, coding, used Adobe Photoshop and everything was working absolutely fine.. But if you want more smooth exotics l experience you can just upgrade the ram to 16gb and this laptop will become beast.."

269,4,Overall best product. One star deducted for late delivery
270,4,"There are only two USB ports.HP should have provided at least four USB ports.Also,cooling ports for the cpu seem to be delicate.Over all a good package.Flipcart packing and delivery top."
271,1,Laptop is very very slow due to absence of ssd....otherwise best laptop in this budget segment .
272,2,"The laptop review is written after a months usage 1. Windows home edition does not have ms office which is needed for any student: misleading information by Flipkart/ HP as they should specify. 2. Computer booting takes considerable time feel that I should have taken SSD rather than 1 TB HDD, seems a bit slow in response (maybe due to Ryzen 5 processors when compared to i5) 3. Very heavy weighing laptop 4. Scroll pad does not have separate buttons below so again left and right clicks are hav..."
273,5,Good packing‚ù§Ô∏è Best customer service‚ù§Ô∏è Budget laptop
274,1,"Never seen a laptop slower than this. Forget gaming, you can't even browse internet on it properly."
275,4,Display good Performance is some Butter It is suitable for only students Not for gamers . But keyboard backlight I'm impresse I am Getting windows licence problem
276,1,I had buy this laptop just some days before. And I'm very much regretted. The battery takes too long time to charge like 3% takes 30 minutes. And the laptop is very very slow and taking too much time to start. And if you play any game it lags very much or even in between game the laptop gets lock. Very disappointed.
277,4,I am using this laptop for 5 months now. It is incredibly good have also give me 140+FPS during gaming. I mostly plays Valorant and it really runs well. But sometime it performs slow whenever i open up any IDE for coading. I am a CS Student and i like to code a lot but sometimes it lags during debugging and compilation of the code. Maybe its because of SSD. I will edit my Review after I install a ssd in it. Maybe after a month or two.
278,5,Beast Product Tested FALL GUYS - 61-75 FPS ON HIGH SETTINGS MINECRAFT - 50-61 FPS ON FANCY SETTINGS NO LAG GTX 1650 IS BEAST RYZEN 5 3550H IS ALSO GOOD
279,5,Good Laptop for gaming and software coding  Pros Backlight keyboard 6Gb graphic card amd + Nvidia 2 ram slot 1 used and 1 in free Amd Ryzen gaming chip  Cons No ssd so we can add ssd also Only 6 gb ram When installing heavy game cpu get 100% so laptop get hanged
280,4,Performance is good and look is awesome but sometimes the hing is producing sound in turbo mood
281,5,Product was good and there is no doubt about Flipkart. I am very happy with this product.
282,4,"4 star is only for in this price they can add a 120gb ssd. Because of hdd machine is lagging to much, response time is high. Others all good."
283,4,The only problem is ram. I was only provided with 6gb of ram and there is no option in bios to free the ram. Else every thing is good.
284,4,Overall laptop is very good but will need add a ssd to it and remember to update your graphic card drivers
285,3,If you are really into gaming and want to buy a high performance laptop do not buy it. Never ever go for Ryzen. I won't suggest you ever. I am writing this honest review after using it for a month. Do not buy it.
286,3,Just need to add sdd and ram then it wll be beast
287,1,Disgusting service from Flipkart and HP.....they stuck my money......third class product they sell
288,5,Best laptop i used it continue after charging
289,5,"This is the best laptop I've ever bought in my life till now. The only lack I feel is that they didn't provide MS office full version for permanent. They've a trial version of very short duration. Now even needs to buy the software separately, I feel the extra expense."
290,3,IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY THEN GO FOR SSD MODEL OF THIS LAPTOP. THE HDD IS VERY SLOW AND SOMETIMES IT'S PERFORMANCE CRASHES. YOU CAN SEE LAGS AND THE BOOT TIME IS SLOW. RAM IS NOT SUFFICIENT AS PER THE GAMING LAPTOP. 2GB RAM IS RESERVED ALREADY FOR AMD RADEON GRAPHICS. WHEN YOU SEE THE TASK MANAGER THEN YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT ONLY AROUND 3GB OF RAM IS USABLE. IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AAA GAMES LIKE GTA5 AND FARCRY THEN DON'T EXPECT IT TO RUN WITHOUT ANY LAGS AND SHUTTERING. OVERALL THE LOOK AND DISP...
291,5,"After one month of Laptop , i felt it is value for money. Only one trouble is that booting time is little longer. If we add a PCIe NVMe card this problem should get resolved"
292,5,"Best in its class. Ram & SSD upgrade is a must other than that no issues, battery üîã is fine ."

300,4,Need to upgrade SSD for smooth but performance with hdd is good for low end users
301,4,Great product . But if possible get yourself a SSD and 8gigs of extra RAM then you will enjoy it at its full capacity. HDD is too slow. And other than that it felt value for money.

304,5,Just wow
305,5,In price approx 50000 the product is very good and performance is also good.

This thing bothers me that you touching your laptop and feel heat. Otherwise all other things are good.  Heating isn't a small issue which you can ignore.

368,5,It is best laptop for gaming
369,5,Every thing is fine but slightly slow due to without ssd and extra ram
370,4,"After 1 week of usage. Should have gone for SSD is the only drawback. There's another slot for expansion, which is a good option. No lag issues and maximum boot time is between 2 - 3 seconds which is good for HDD these days. Ryzen 5 is just out of the box. Battery life is also good. We can manually enable 4K with AMD settings on the system."
371,3,Not for value for money
372,2,I think it is refreshing
373,2,"Sent a defective laptop after placing an order it took just 4 days to deliver the product but when I applied for returns its been 8 days still the product is with me, the procedure to return anything is pathetic product is good only need to install an ssd for better percormance"
374,5,"Great Machine, Got it for 52k on sale and it is worth every penny, played Doom, Doom Eternal, GTA V, Just Cause and other great titles without even a single lag. go for it without a second thought :)"
375,5,Excellent Performance with this affordable price
376,1,Extremely Slow and poor performance! The specifications look impressive only on paper but the falsely hyped Laptop is extremely disappointing. It takes over 4 minutes to boot and several seconds to open applications. The battery life is around 1.5 hours so you have to rely on constant power to continue working. HP support is not impressive because the customer service team isn't technically qualified to resolve common issues. Would strongly advise against buying HP laptops.
377,5,Fantasticüòç
378,4,It's nice product
379,5,Please provide atleast 128 gb SSD for fast boot .One of the best laptop and gorgeous look.

502,5,"Very nice,, ???"
503,1,"I dont know what the issue is but the performance is very very poor,the booting takes almost 45sec,games are unplayable,also it crashes a lot. For some weird reason the usable ram i get is only 5.88 gb out of 8gb. Opted for the return option,but weirdly flipkart has only replace option,that too with only the same product. My friend just bought the same product,he is facing the same issue! Update:- received the replacement unit, still a shitbox,slow af,i guess the whole lot is defective"
504,1,The main reason for giving just one star is nothing but their amd on board gpu which reserves 2gb of the total ram in the system which seriously affect the gaming performance. Overheating is another issue.
505,1,performance too much slow. don't buy this product .it's waste of money
506,1,The product is not good with 6 gb ram but if you add another 8 gb of ram and 256 gb of ssd then it is a beast.
507,5,Very slow processor
508,2,Takes too long to start... High graphic games lag
509,2,cant play gta 5 smoothly with this 6gb ram a lot of lag occuring
510,1,Battery back up has been reduces to 2 hrs with in 2 weeks and laptop charge rate is 6% per hour
511,4,"Battery drains very fast & this laptop is super slow. The main problem is in this laptop it's take so much time to start (one &half minute maximum) & it's folder opening speed also very slow,"
512,1,"screen bleeding issue noted, i return"
513,2,"I wanted to write this review because there are couple of things not worth.  1 Design is awesome. 2 Sound is awesome. 3 Display is awesome. 4 Performance disappointed me, I bought the laptop two days back and it‚Äôs hanging many times. Even before checked game performance. single HD movie also hanged many time in two hours.  Before buying this laptop please check other laptops in this price range and compare with hardware."
514,1,Very slow laptop
515,1,Don't buy this model. Boot time is above 3 min and the laptop is laggy
516,1,The Laptop is good But the Service of Flipkart is extremely poor
517,5,"Best Laptop, I got it for 48897 Good graphic performance feels a bit slower because of AMD Ryzen 5 3550H and no ssd alongwith. display is good battery backup is good sound quality is average It is a light weight laptop around 1.8 kgs looks very stunning"
518,2,"I purchased this Laptop looking at all the reviews, and also after going through expert comments and reviews on different websites. I really like the design, look and aesthetics of the Laptop.  However, when it comes to performance, I am terribly upset with the boot speed. I understand this doesn't have an SSD, but even with a Hard Disk, that too with the specs that his Laptop comes with, taking close to 2 minutes or more to get to the Windows 10 logon screen is too much. Moreover after loggi..."
519,1,Horrible cpu I was a intel user from long time i suggested this laptop to my cousin after seeing the spec list and budget friendly This laptop can over heat easily and shuts down with in no time when cpu reach 85 degrees While playing 2013 gta5 everytime laptop shutsdown after 20-30min of playing when temp reaching 90 I never suggest amd processer again
520,1,"I am using this laptop from 15 days plz don't buy this laptop it stop working, I am pissed of plz buy a laptop to your near storyüò¢"
521,1,DONT BUY THIS...........its very very slow Sometimes it freeze for no reason It take atleast 1 min to startup Cant even shutdown the system  NOT SATISFIED AT ALL
522,1,Booting time is too long even with min loading apps. Apps loading time is also too long. Battery drains too fast.
523,1,Worst laptop of all time. Very slow and battery was a useless and causing issue within 15 days of buying
524,2,Very slow laptop
525,1,"Worst product , Device not getting on after installation Just one day of use , laptop turned to be useless"
526,1,Very very slow üòí performance. Slow processor very disappoint
527,1,Please don't purchase it because after finding lots of diificulties when I talked to the HP customer care they told me that windows is not provided by them may be flipkart has given windows 10 means hp has provided with simple docs nothing.  Actually I purchased this laptop after reading all the review but what I observed it a very slow battery is ok only and screen gets freezes I think about 50 times with in only 20days and boot up issue. Takes about 1 to 2 minutes to start the laptop after...
528,4,Due to the hdd... it's boot time and app opening time is slow but overall it's ok for a budget gamer.... The design is awesome as a gamming laptop but the top flex is visible. Built of the top is slightly disappointing. But the overall the built quality is ok. The huge disappointing thing in this laptop is that the usable ram is only 5.4GB out of 8 gb I'm very disappointed for that.
529,2,"A gaming laptop, which cannot survive browser tabs more than 5, while simple apps are running in the background (Spotify, Trello, Telegram)."
530,1,Very slow laptop not working fast
531,1,Boot time around 2mints every time and profomnce not good
532,1,Laptop is getting slow while charging... started after onemonth of purchasing... not getting any help from hp after compalining multiple times... hp is reallyy worse for me
533,1,Battery is week.
534,5,Its very slow boot up time is aprrox 2 minutes also i takes 20 30 seconds to open any application btw good for gaming but very slow
535,1,Too slow performance
536,2,Please not buy this üôèüèªin 5days it have lots of issues worest battery slow boot time
537,2,Booting Takes Much time (more than 5 min). Speaker sounds are very low. system performance is low.  Display is good. Battery Backup is okk as of now since the use is less and gaming is not done. Could have included SSD Hard disk.
538,4,Good working
539,2,Not really satisfied with the product and the entire process till possession of it. Laptop takes forever to boot up. The response time is very slow. I don't know if you can run games smoothly takes forever to open Chrome.
540,1,heating issue lagging takes forever to load windows 50k wasted
541,2,I was using this laptop since September 2020 it hang a lot

543,4,Avarage
544,4,Very good
545,4,"Some softwares seems to be pixelated. Also, I could notice some lag during the file transfer. Multi tasking is not at most good for 8gb ram. It still has to be more efficient."
546,5,"used very well no issue reported as of now, little bit slow due to HDD."
547,5,Very good product..
548,5,Good
549,4,Battery is not God
550,3,Performance is slow
551,3,Best on this price range
552,4,If u r going for gaming then u should upgrade SSD and Ram then it becomes beast.
553,5,Best for Multitasking and multiprocessing
554,5,Better than expected....üî•‚ù§ awesome product
555,4,"Slow booting up with hdd,, but overall good in price segment..."
556,4,Worth the money
557,5,"This laptop is literally amazing. But, a bit slow cause of hdd.. I'm certain it'll get much faster after adding an ssd."
558,4,The laptop takes very long to boot up...every app that I open takes very long to start..I don't know what the problem is...sometimes the laptop just freezes.....and while playing fifa 18 I noticed some frame drops which should not have been....because the GTX 1650 is a great processor....I tried to consult with the hp support ...but they said it's not the laptop defect....it's windows defect
559,1,This laptop is broken down within a month
560,2,"Laptop functions quite slow, starting from power ON. Even same with browsing. I observe buffer. Takes lot time to open application and switch between them.. Not upto the mark. Facing issues while using office tools. Not worth the investment of 55K."
561,5,"i like this laptop ,used outocad and heavy game smoothly"
562,1,I received a defective piece which is not getting on. Display is completely defective. I received this item as gift and hence took 20 days to unwrap. Now Flipkart says you only have the option to contact HP helpdesk. Really purchasing expensive items online for Gifts is risky because 7 day return policy gets overs till the time gift is unwrapped
563,5,"Writing review after using it for 5 months approx. It is best in market got at 49998 only. Used matlab and ansys software it has no lag. Played games like resident evil 6 , gta 5, mafia 3 . It is running game at 1080p at 40-60 fps. No issue of lag or heating is there. After playing for half an hour fan are starting to run but they are giving very cold air so no issue of beat. Temperature of graphic card maximum goes to 55 degree during games. Battery is .out 12 hrs on simple use and 6 hours o..."
564,4,Everything is good except an SSD would make a lot of difference in performance...and secondly the processor is little slower than intel i5 8th or 9th gen. But it is good compared to other gaming laptops in battery backup.
565,4,This is my first laptop And I m very happy with this Build quality-(7/10) is good in this price Display - 8/10 Keyboard-10/10 Camera- 3/10 Speaker-8/10 Cooling -8/10 Mousepad -6/10 Battery - 7/10 ( 4:30-5:00 hour in normal browsing and watching videos ) If you play games on battery then it gives only 30 -fps (so plug your charger when you play games And laptop is very slow after playing gta 5 lagging too much
566,1,Too slow.. I used only 1weak.. The Performance is very slow..
567,5,Very good laptop must buy....it is very good for engineering students and fulfilling all requirements which we want for design purpose in this price..
568,1,Very bad to use on multiprocessing.
569,4,This laptop is very good But you have to upgrade the ram and ssd After upgrading it will become beast
570,5,"Excellent for the price but the ram we get is about 6gb, which is enough for day to day tasks but not for gaming... upgrading the ram is a must. HDD is a bit slow but if you want that snapiness in windows you can add an SSD. battery life is ok-ish of about 4 hrs"
571,4,"I got this laptop only in 47,000 .... I am so happy with this product (till now) Battery last long about 5-6 Hr in normal video streaming"
572,3,Bro the speed is really very slow like its hangs for like 30sec after i close a game and booting time is 1min 10secs .... If anyone can fix this please let me know coz i had put all my 3 year savings on this laptop
573,3,Battery backup not so good. Games very slow
574,5,Best laptop is this price segment
575,5,I happy with hp laptop and flipkart service. Thank you flipkart
576,4,it takes too much time to boot .it takes around 1;30 minutes
577,1,I got a faulty product.
578,5,Hmm somewht battry issue but performance is beast
579,1,Laptop is getting strucked when I use it for more than 3 hr
580,5,Very good laptop at its price range Best design Battery ok No doubt you can go for it
581,1,I am using this laptop for about 4 months and it had ruined my experience it is worst thing i have purchased ever  it take about 1 minute to start or boot and still after that it get hanged up  i had run many softwares as an graphic designer and every time it screwed up at every last moment and  as for hp support they always tell to reset the pc on every call and every update never download properly  As for heating concern it heats alot if fans are not given it may explode Very cheap qual...
582,1,Laptop dead on arrival
583,1,"It is very slow due to low Ram, even GTA 5 doesn't work."
584,2,The product advertises that it can be upgraded upto 1TB SSD but it cannot and HP confirmed that. The laptop is also very slow. I was not at all happy with it. It‚Äôs supposed to be a gaming laptop but if it‚Äôs so slow how can one play!!! This false advertisement on the sellers part is unforgivable.
585,3,Go for ssd varient It lacks even in bluestacks
586,3,"I'm writing this after using it for 3 months.  Considering the configuration it has, the laptop is extremely slow. It takes nearly 3 mins just to switch on. App loading is very slow. While playing game as well, game stutters (FIFA 19). So, performance wise, not at all good.  Looks is great. Keyboard backlight looks attractive, however you can't keep backlight on all the time as it consumes reasonable battery as well. If you keep the backlight off, since the keyboard letters are written in pu..."
587,2,There is only 5.9 gb usable ram in this laptop...
588,4,Battery backup is very low and performance is ok ok.! You can invest 5-10k more and go gor some better option.!
589,5,Very nice product..Perfect for Heavy gaming if you upgrade ram to 16gb..but its also nice to play with 8gb ram..only negative is booting time
590,1,Take so much time for booting... Too slow
591,5,Everything is great. Butiful Experience. But there is one problem HD varient is slow If you want faster experience Go for SSD varient
592,1,Machine is too slow. I think the performance issue is related to hdd and windows 10. Need to wait long time for machine to become responsive else it will show 100% disk usage. Users cant change the bios settings as its locked.
593,1,Worst laptop and worst service by Flipkart
594,1,Hangs alot. Poor performance. Worst battery. Discharged within every 3 hour. Very poor experience. Even copying a single folder of 10 GB from one drive to another take about 1 hour time
595,4,I bought the laptop for more than 3 months now if you are a gamer go for an upgrade of ssd which will make your overall performance good The speakers are stunning compare to other laptops the b&o audio took it to the next level Display is epic with the streaming 4k video which is cool 8gb ram only 6 gb usable because of the consumption of integrated graphics card While gaming with hdd face lag issues for nfs payback bit after a bit its okay After a month i face a little bit of crashing issue...
596,3,Battry backup is very poor ... And please do not order this product ...without ssd it has very slow processor...
597,2,I use this laptop 1 months its performance are soo bad lak problem software very slow working and so many problems
598,1,Physical memory installed is 8.0 GB but out of it only 5.88GB is usable. They have no explanation about this. They haven't mentioned this in their specifications. Think before you buy.
599,1,Too much from the date of purchase..
600,5,The Laptop if you can get it around 48 with the SBI or HDFC cards offer then it's a really great deal. The HDDs a bit slow but that's nothing an SSD won't fix and an additional 8 gigs of Ram would make any other entry level gaming laptop run for its money. Bottomline with another 7k investment this will beat anything else below 60-65k
601,1,The delivery boy was a bit rude ...Design display and battery is good...but it seems a bit slow after updating the drivers it's ok ..booting time is 40-60 sec ..maybe due to less ram(6gb and 2gb Vega graphics) and HDD..after upgrading ram and adding ssd ...This will be a beast... everything else seems good..no heating problem..so if u think about this laptop this is ok and after upgrading with about 6-8k it will give best performance...like if you want any updates ....  After 10 days of u...
602,1,hard disk speed is too slow always shows 100% disk usage and games are lagging like hell.
603,1,Worst product Very slow
604,1,Laptop generates lot of heat while using it Lags a lot while playing Gta5 Laptop takes 3minutes to boot up It takes 20-30 seconds to respond for a click when there is no background app running. Performance is much less than an average laptop which is half the cost of this laptop. HP shouldn't call this a gaming laptop at all and the price is way too higher for the poor value delivered.
605,5,Simply superb üòçüòä
606,2,Laptop is a beast but very poor battery don't expect for a long time gaming should use while charging battery drains within 1hr for gaming and 2hrs of normal usage
607,1,Very very slow performance üòè. Processor very slow I'm not satisfied
608,5,Best in all way....
609,3,Heating and lag issue...
610,1,"Not a good laptop, built quality is low, very slow"
611,3,"Battery life is bad 1 hr approx..... anykind of work except gaming.....   Performance is also bad booting time 20 to 25sec shut down time 38 sec to 45 sec   Can any body tell me which one of the drivers i should install as hp support is showing many drivers ....bios, graphics,firmware,hd audio and many more....??????"
612,4,"This is a good laptop.I played farcry 3,farcry 4 without SSD or ram upgrade.But BlueStacks lags.If you are a freefire player you can play lag free in smooth only.Charge don't last long.For gaming 10min it drops more than 20%.With charged only u get smooth fps.If u upgrade ram and SSD it may be good."
613,4,Nice good laptop
614,5,Hdd is littel slow but you upgrade ssd then this laptop is beast in performance
615,5,Good laptop for casual work and gaming
616,5,Once it will taking lot of time for booting but it's assume look and quality when we will upgrade ram and ssd it will become a beast laptop happy to buying beautiful laptop. When I received small bending in touch pad but it working so I didn't replaced for very small bend it works nice
617,5,It's the beast go for it
618,4,This product is great in the price range of 49K. I would suggest to upgrade ssd and ram after purchase as it will turn this into a more powerfull machine. The only shortfall I found was the fact that bios locks the advanced settings area which limits ram of this lap to 6 or 5.8 gb and wastes the potential of 2 gb in igpu which is not needed as it has a dedicated gpu as well
619,1,I got a hang issue from the beginning. Now its 3 month's and it's still the same
620,5,"Boot time is a little slow but other than that I have know complains. Solid build quality, great screen, good speakers, respectable battery life, bang for the buck gaming performance. Overall very satisfied"
621,5,beast laptop at this price
622,5,Definitely add a SSD to it... Otherwise the lap is too slow to boot up and run... Its a plus to add up to 1tb ssd upon the inbuilt HDD.
623,3,This laptop is very good but other 0battery is very bad for me only one hour play game I am suggest a pc for gaming but this is good
624,1,Very poor performance... takes almost an hour to start That too after restarting after 4-5 times Very slow  Worst laptop ever experienced
625,5,good
626,1,Its not working properly
627,5,Great after 1 week of use
628,1,Even I right click for refresh ..it take lot off time ...even not installed any other software...
629,3,"Everything was okay except the performance is slow due to HDD, better to go for SDD version"
630,5,Good products
631,5,u can use it for normal use gaming and much better battery and backlit keyboard is best
632,4,3 day used. I purchased this product only for normal purpose and Adobe Photoshop. This is good for me
633,3,Battery is is week and speed is also slow recommend ssd drive
634,5,Very good product value for money
635,5,I am totally impressed with this product Worth for Money Under 50k best gaming laptop
636,5,Beat product in mid-range. Beast of mid-range. If your budget is 50000 i prefer you to buy this laptop. It's a beast.
637,4,Overall pretty good gaming experience but poor battery
638,5,Genuinely good product after 1 week of use. Using mainly for programming will start gaming and review later. So far good laptop. I love this gadget.
639,1,Dnt buy very slow while using cad software
640,1,Works very slow manytimes real reviews after 3 months
641,4,It is good... Boot tym is slow... But it could be solved by increasing the ram....
642,5,Good Product
643,5,Looks premium but gets oil marks everywhere. Ssd is a must if you want fast loading speed. Upgrade ram also if you do multitasking of heavy apps
644,1,"Don't Buy this Laptop,, wasted... Performance is not good .. display blinking., Power is inconsistent.. flipkart members also not responding for solving problem... This app is 200percemt waste ... Don't use this App"
645,4,Very very good.... I am completely satified
646,5,I bought this for mobile game development and coding and unteal engine and other apps work smoothly on this . Also gta v runs perfectly. No need to add ssd but yes ram can be upgraded to 16 gb to even more enhance the laptop but without it also it works fantastic.
647,3,I can play free fire with lag
648,5,Awesome product
649,1,Waste of money
650,3,Decent product
651,5,That is amazing performance...
652,5,Excellent
653,3,U can fell the lag and don't even dare to install BlueStacks.It'll hang
654,4,Everything is perfect according to the price but it definitely needs a ssd upgrade Rest all is excellent
655,4,Beast
656,5,All rights but boot is very slow
657,5,It was really a nice product
658,2,Some game like frozen 4 is not run nice till now bad is that the 8gb Ram is mentioned but 2gb is already use By system we get only 5.88gb Ram usable gaming experience is not good not bad also some game run smoothly but some are not
659,1,Booting time is to long very slow performance and not worth it
660,3,Not satisfied with the performance speed...
661,2,After 6 month of User It‚Äôs really slow Takes lot of time to start
662,5,Very nice product . Delivery before time . Satisfying ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
663,4,Entry level laptop
664,4,Nice one. Increase ram for better productivity. That's it. People say go for SSD. But it isn't compulsory. HDD works fine as well.
665,4,Best in value for money...as it's HDD so performance is quite slow
666,5,Good performance...
667,5,It is best under prize range
668,5,"I would say this laptop is value for money, a great machine from HP. Since there is no SSD pre installed, I would say, it would be great if the user installs an SSD after purchasing this device. I have installed an SSD onto the machine and now most of the games I'm getting more FPS and more enjoyable."
669,5,Excellent product delivered only with in 2 days
670,1,Charging port loose connection & very slow performance

673,3,Little bit slow in start otherwise if works smooth And you should upgrade to ssd then it gives good performance
674,5,Great product.
675,3,Product ok but we need to upgrade to ssd
676,4,Nice and best product as per specification but only battery backup is needed and i will suggest tjat if you are buying this product then please insert an SSD for smooth and better experience in it.
677,5,Nyc product
678,3,Dont expect too much
679,3,While running editing softwares for coding or some other big softwares...it slows down coz of the 6gb ram(+2gb internal graphics)...ram upgrade and ssd upgrade can help sort this issue....otherwise 5 out 5 on value for money.
680,4,Superb quality
681,4,Gud product and value for money
682,3,If thay have added even a 128Gb SSD means it's an amazing deal..
683,1,"Without SSD and 8 GB memory the system is unusable.  Having put 256 GB SSD and 8 GB more memory, the system performance is very good.  Not sure why they have not made it default configuration."
684,4,"Laptop is good for mid-level gaming and official purpose. Design is classy, suitable for both gaming and office.  Recommended: upgrade to 500gb ssd and 8gb ddr4 ram for ultra performance."
685,5,super very good lop top
686,5,Nicee
687,5,You can play games on High settings but on very High or ultra high settings it started lagging so you can play on High settings or medium settings smoothly

690,5,"This laptop is completely an insane beast,i loved it, the performance is very good and the battery back-up is also good. However, firstly to get the best out of it, please update all the laptop drivers i.e graphics, processor, mother board, bios etc, the updates will take over 2-3 hours on speed internet,  Also, because of of the 1 TB HDD, the performance is quite low, but once the laptop is upgrade to SSD and extra 8GB or 16GB RAM it is completely insane beast.

736,5,The quality and build is awesome. Best low cost laptop.
737,4,Indeed it's a great laptop looking at the specs but I have never seen a laptop which is this slow just because of a HDD. Other HDD laptop works really fast than this thing. If you're purchasing this laptop either purchase the SSD varient or buy SSD separately and install. HDD of this laptop is too damn slow. Otherwise Graphics is great. Battery backup is decent. Display is crisp. Design is great.
738,5,Good
739,4,Only disadvantage that I expect is fast battery draining (2-3 hr normal usage )... Except this a nice picküî•
740,5,You can buy this laptop if your budget is under 50k Best laptop under 50k if u add an ssd it boost the performance
741,4,Display is decent with good viewing angles and no color shift and all But the battery life is pathetic as it discharge 40-45% in 1 hrs as my use ( im not a gamer ) i was just running some very basic tasks like html file and thats it.. the speed you is also bad beacuse of hhd but if you add and extra m.2 nvme ssd it becomes baburao ;) but as it ships with hhd so you have to face slow boot time and app loading till you upgrade to ssd .. and yes it does heats near hhd area so energy loss it defi...

798,3,"1. First thing which matters is it's built quality. The plastic hp uses in front side of laptop is very pure,you can easily press it and if you give some little pressure on it it can be borke. you can't think that it's a laptop's plastic. Many toys have better plastic than it. It is not a long lasting laptop as the outer surface is weak. Easily fingertips shows anywhere of laptop. Touchpad is also not out of mark.  2.

835,3,"VERY DISAPPOINTED Given the specs it should work like high end device but disappointed me a lot, it takes time to open any kind of application and if we install any sort of game then device starts hanging."
836,3,"Without ssd as its boot drive it feels very slow when starting, and sometimes feels like lagging when tried to run few applications at once."
837,3,"Slow processor ,only 5.9gb ram available."

857,1,Very slow. Startup takes 15 mins.
858,5,"If you are going to buy this order a 8gb 2400mhz ram with it else the ram will bottleneck the GTX 1650 and u may think that the laptop is not efficient, cuz of integrated graphics only 5.88gb of ram available  a perfect classic gamming laptop , u can use this for both professional use and gamming .it doesn't look aggressive as other gamming laptop .

859,5,Good
860,5,Product is good.. Satisfied
861,2,5.58 gb ram only usable pls avoid to buy this laptop Its booting time is not fast it take too much time Design was awsome.but its has only design...
862,4,Everything seems to be perfect except at this price range we deserve ssd and slightly better build quality . Overall nice experience.
863,5,This laptop is very good but if u need gaming faster then you need to attach a ssd around 140GB or 240Gb.
864,4,All good but processing low because HDD. So i recommend buy with SSD
865,5,Super good
866,4,Everything is good but it takes long time to boot.
867,4,Battery is a average factor 3/5... But overall price and features 4/5.
868,3,Battery not good...only works 3 hrs
869,4,At this price its worth buying without a second thought.
870,4,Good
871,3,Battery in high performance is only 30 to 50 minute
872,5,Best Product Truly
873,4,"Good product for basic level gaming, designing, autocad, photo shop and it comes with good price"
874,3,Don't buy ryzen take intel
875,5,Just amazing
876,5,The best
877,4,"Best laptop for this price range, Best display. Performance is great, it has extra slot for ram and ssd. The only drawback is that hp locked the bios due to this the vega graphics reserves 2 gb ram so only 6 gb ram is usable because of this games like GTA V, Shadow of the tomb raider, RDR 2 stutters (playable but annoying). Upgrading the Ram to 16 gb fix this issues and makes this a bang for the buck."
878,4,Nice
879,3,Battery backup is very worst
880,3,"Average one , battery drain is too fast, much lags we will face even while normal use also."
881,5,"The laptop is great overall and the GTX1650ti can run most modern AAA games, display is awesome and performance is good... BUT A RAM AND SSD UPGRADE IS MUST... And battery life is somewhat short but that's expected from a gaming laptop.  Get at least a RAM upgrade (if u don't mind longer booting and loading times) and this beast is ready to go"
882,5,In this price range You can get this as a best deal... the battery backup could be better... otherwise product is best üî•
883,5,The heating is more and gaming are lagaing But good
884,5,Received the product within 03 days of placing order. Performance is great considering the price point. AMD does a great job and is comparable to i5 9th gen. Overall recommended.
885,4,If you are a gaming person than ram upgradation is must. Build quality is upto the mark in this price range .
886,5,Very nice products
887,1,"I had an issue as there was a stuck pixel on my laptop and even though it's a manufacturing defect, hp does not want to help me. I'm also under warranty."
888,5,Only upgrade to ssd and it will be a rocket
889,4,Great gaming laptop in this price range. You can easily play most modern games on High settings and get around 45-60 fps.  One thing that they don't tell you us that 2gb RAM is reserved for the integrated graphics so you only have around 5.9 gb RAM available which can cause issues with latest games. So I would suggest getting an extra 8gb RAM if you want to smoothly play all the latest titles.
890,4,It is a great budget buy as it has capacity to upgrade Like extra ram slot (which you require soon as ryzen blocks 2 gb by default) and m0.2 slot for SSD so ample opportunity to upgrade value for money
891,5,Excellent product
892,2,Microsoft office home & Student not installed in this laptop.Buy seperately cost 8000 Rs.
893,4,Great
894,1,Vesy slow performance unexpected from HP
895,5,Go for it if you want a good laptop for gaming and video editing
896,3,Lagging not satisfied with the product
897,3,This laptop hangs. Like seriously after this much of processors and RAMs. Should have gone for SSD one thats beast.
898,1,It claims 8gb ram but only 6gb is usable. The processor gets very slow eventually.. Not good for gaming
899,1,Third class laptop no refund
900,5,Good machine in this prise segment I suggest only this device
901,5,ALL ARE GOOD. - Only things what I am Missing... Is SSD - Awesome laptop with very good performance - Got this @46 in Diwali Sale..
902,5,Great performance and looking too good
903,5,"Best laptop in this price range . If you are playing games casually then this must be your choice. Initially the games will get lag but if u add 8 GB ram upgrade the laptop works smoothly any games at 16 GB ram. So ram upgrade is must. I play PUBG PC, GTA 5, Valorant , Warzone,Apex Legends,Fortnite,CS Go, Watchdogs 2,RDR 2etc.... You can play any high specs game only with a ram upgrade. Battery is the only problem with this lap but while u r playing games just plug in the charger and play you..."

909,5,Except battery all are good in this price range... U can buy it
910,3,Overall Nice but it will hang when you will run multiple software and chrome
911,2,After 2months use... Trust me guys the system is too slow and my old pc with 2 gb ram was faster... Tried calling the customer support many times and no resolution the laptop is still slow. Normal things take time like even if I want to open browser or my computer it srsly takes atleast 45-50secs which is slow for a 8gb ram laptop and imagine playing games or using heavy softwares. Battery hardly holds for 2hrs drains like anything and even when I fully charge the laptop and it's turned off ...
912,5,"The only major issue is battery backup ,which can be seen in all the gaming laptops . But once you connect it to a charger then you will get the real beast out of it . Considering the price, the laptop delivers great performance and quality of the product is very good. Total graphical memory is 5 gb ( 4gb From Nvidia+1 gb from RAM ). I'll recommend you all to upgrade your pc with an ssd of 250gb and a ram of atleast 4gb"

919,5,Very good product. Delivery was very fast
920,1,Its a average laptop to buy at this price point. Everything is average except for the ram it uses. I don't know why but out of the 8gbram is only 5gb is useable. This seriously slows down the laptop. Can't change the settings through bios because it is locked by HP  Do check the physical condition of the laptop. The first one i got had a problem with the F6 key.it came out of the keyboard.
921,1,Received defective product. Flipkart replaced it. After replacing again received defective product. Didn't expect this from flipkart or hp. Worst experience ever.
922,3,Laptop isn't that great until it has an ssd in it because without ssd it's just frustrating to use this lap Otherwise for gaming it's a beast and for multitasking too Go for this one if u have a budget below 50k
923,5,"On battery the display is good.. otherwise without battery the light is low. Gaming is smooth with 12Gb ram and 16Gb ram for COD warzone, GTA V, Assassin creed series including Odyssey, Apex Legends, Horizon zero dawn etc"

925,5,Very nice model with good performance

928,4,Ok
929,5,It's pretty decent laptop. The only problem is it doesn't support hardware virtualization. It means you won't be able to use virtual box or VMware. Just think before you purchase
930,1,"On Flipkart page it was written 0% intrest EMI from Kotak Bank. But both cheated as Bank started charging intrest. And on complaining to both, no solution was done. They just tossed the ball in other party's area to resolve the problem. Atlast I made prepayment of that emi to save the intrest amount"
931,5,Excellent
932,5,Nice

940,3,Buy asus better then this
941,3,Upgrade to ssd. Boot up is pretty slow as well as opening softwares. But a RAM too if you want a lili but of additional performance
942,4,Battery backup is not so good but all other features are just amazing üî•
943,4,"If you upgrade it with an extra 8gb ram supported with SSD, then there shouldn't be any complaint about its performance. Yes, sometimes the mouse cursor gets stuck somewhere, but that is only for a second and not frequently. It handles most of the new generation or AAA games pretty much efficiently. Overall, I'm really satisfied. But you need to upgrade it with SSD and another 8gb of ram."
944,3,"Gud laptop in this price range! Gave 3star becouse HD version is so slow, go for an SSD version or add an SSD to it."
945,2,"Not very satisfying performance, I got a damaged products for the first time and the replacement process in one word ""Degaster"". Finally after more then 50 call I got the replacement after 18 days. So simply avoid the product."
946,4,Not gud for this price better to go with ssd
947,2,The laptop is very slow probably due to so many adm drivers. Look is very cool but very low grade performance.

Games not running smoothly sometimes game freezes for couple of seconds while playing. Sometimes even if i don't play a game it hangs."
956,3,Overall decent laptop. Loud fans. Bootup time is slow for a new laptop. No heating issue so far. Above average for gaming and general use.

963,5,"Worth money .... nothing much to say ,it's a good product on a whole sole performance"
964,3,"After using 1 month I am writing this review. Look wise it's fine 4.5+. And performance is bit OK not that much. It's 4 out of 5. I thought Ryzen could be faster then intel but my previous i3 n i5 lenono, HP and dell they are fine. Not much but little bit compare to this. It will take little longer then normal non gaming laptops which are i3 or i5. But while gaming this was better then those, not much heating not struck while playing games, and display is cool. Battery also fine, not expect ..."
965,3,"Honest review after 2 mont of use - This laptop though shows that it's a budget gaming laptop but for a leser time in the sense , Battery - Battery life is so bad it just gets vanish from 100 to 1 in 80 min gameplay of high fps game (without charger ) so i recomend you to always play with charger.  Fps/GPU - the GPU is pretty powerful but it under perform due to low specs if bought separately it give around 150-200 fps , but in this laptop it is like 60-120 in( valorant ) fps games .  Proce..."
966,4,"I've been using this laptop just over a month now. Overall it is a very good laptop for this price(48,600). It is a bit slow though, due to no ssd. Gaming is pretty good, runs high spec games smoothly. It may go to sleep while playing games. You just have to update your bios to F 10. If you'll install an ssd , and upgrade the ram, it will increase the performance."
967,3,This is best laptop at this budget ...but compare to pavillion ryzen 5 vs aspire 7 i think aspire 7 is best and given best perfomance level if the budget is same go for aspire 7 or if you need to buy this laptop You should insert ssd on it...

969,1,"worst laptop ever. you cant even run small games on this laptop. even restart take about 5 min. you cant even play pubg pc in the very low setting. gg hp, they said it has 8GB of ram but 2.1GB of was already occupied by unknown hardware. I should have returned this waste of plastic if know it cant even run a single game."

Was sceptical about going for ryzen 5 series, but the gaming and overall performance is just great. Display is good, not great but the design takes away the show. The backlit keyboard is nice, no rgb mode and i personally would prefer white light than this voilet kinda backlit keyboard, gives a bit of a eye strain. I would suggest cloning the OS in a ssd (it sup..."

If you are confused between this and MSI GF63, buy this one! In msi you will encounter heating issues and excessive fan noise but not in this one. One important thing DO NOT OPEN IT YOURSELF IT WILL VOID YOUR WARRANTY. Lastly just go for it!"

996,3,"It's an okayish laptop. But u won't find any other laptops offering the specs which this lap is offering in the price range. It takes approx 30-90- sec to start and all the apps open very slow. Moreover, only 5.88 GB ram can be used out of the 8GB as 2GB ram is reserved for igpu this makes the games to lag a bit and they cant be run in max settings. I am personally a bit disappointed but I can't blame HP as they have tried to give a gaming lap in the extreme budget range. But the best remedy ..."

1005,5,"I got this laptop at Rs 49,000 at the time of big billion sale. The look is excellent. Surely, the screen is incomparable with other laptops at this rate. I have played Asphalt 9 in this laptop, the experience was fantastic due to its graphics card. The screen really, has wide angle view. There is absolutely no problem with hinges. Built up quality is excellent. Speaker is awesome (5 stars). Laptop heats very little during gamming. Finally, I am happy to purchased this laptop."
1006,5,They say it's Gaming Laptop but to actually play games on it with a decent FPS (60-70) you have upgrade ram as well as install SSD!
1007,5,"its a awesome laptop, only draw back is the battery, but that too is that bad, it does'nt heat up or anything, but if you play high graphical powered games like GTA 5, WATCHDOGS, etc, it last about only an hour in battery settings high performance. it does'nt lag or shuts down randomly. if you are looking for a reliable laptop with good graphics and high performance gaming. perfect laptop for you."
1008,1,"Flipkart and hp, I'm really disappointed in both you with this slow lagging machine. I have seen so many videos that told me that this machine is a very good option but even after spending 55k rupees in this dabba. I'm not even able to use Chrome on it. It's that slow. Yes, not even Chrome. HP people are you sure, you are one of the best companies. You have made this lagging box, just so i can regret trusting you again. I thought maybe 55k is enough for me to get a decent laptop for daily use..."

They told they will give me 11k discount but when they came they told a reason which isn't mentioned in the check list but still they told us to pay 7k more so I could only get discount for 4k Everything was good the laptop was fast it had good spec...

Even though you expect the gaming laptop to have good speed, you can't just pile up tasks on it and expect it to run smooth.  Also, a lot of people are complaining about the battery, which is absolutely ridiculous. The high grade cpu and GPU obviously take more energy than your regular potato pc. Also, if you run a heavy app, the laptop is bound to lose energy quickly.  Overall, a good pu..."

Design is simple and doesn't look very aggressive like other gaming laptops.The complete body is made of plastic but is well built considering the price.  There is lag for almost 5 min when turned on after that functions smoothly.CAD softwares like AutoCAD,3dsmax and photoshop works fine.

1036,5,Highly recommended one. Excellent performance. The system is so fast . And more importantly nice and handy to use.
1037,1,"I wouldn't recommend you this laptop. I started facing small problems like really slow performance and hang. Now, it's been only a few days and it won't even start. It's not going past the welcome screen. I tried everything but it's stuck at welcome. The laptop asked for an update and it all started from there. I installed just one game and played it less than 1 hr. I am really upset and angry"
1038,3,"It does say it's a gaming laptop but most of the high level games do not run smoothly, and it gets hanged frequently while gaming. Not the best laptop for gaming."
1039,2,Not bad
1040,4,"Overall Good and value for money. I brought this 49k. But if u are doing some heavy task like heavy coding then the ram is not sufficient for you, you need to upgrade it."

1051,5,Its a beast at this price. Go for it. I played GTA 5 and it ran smoothly but obviously not on ultra high graphics. It's good for everything mainly gaming. But you should upgrade your ram to 16gb for maximum performance.

1094,5,"this is an awesome laptop it's good for programmers actually because programmers don't need much of video memory because there is not a lot of graphic intensive task that they do it's just about a good multi core processor. also when you have such a good build quality in a laptop you kind of are more focused into your work because you feel good when your working. :) and also there is a lot of online resources you can look come to for its review... thanks for making such good product, apple."
1095,5,A decent purchase at very low rate thanks to flipkart's sale offer..good packing and faster delivery. I found it a bit hard to use in the beginning since I was a Windows user for the past 12 years..but once your familiar it's really fun to use apple ecosystem..I would recommend as this is a good buy..since all the other newer versions of apple have USB type c ports which is not widely used which will result in buying an adaptor.
1096,5,"I bought this laptop after wondering if it's justified enough for me to purchase a MacBook Pro 13"" in India which costed nearly 122k with just 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD, now having purchased a base config MacBook Air, I am very happy, mainly because I was able to buy it for under 45k by exchanging my older Lenovo laptop which was giving me a severe headache.

With each update the functionality becomes better. i will divide this mac in between pros and cons. PROS: 1) Battery life is amazing 9-10hours to the max even if you use it continuously. 2) Can edit videos...
1099,5,excellent performance as expected.Camera quality is very good compare to others.Battery life is just a nightmare for other laptops.This mac is best for those users whose idea empowers towards multitasking.Charging point is magnetic and protected from a cover.Long charging wire and a classic design.Overall a very good choice for multitaskers.Finally great delivery by flipkart everything is okay inside the box and packaging is just terrific

If you are looking something for 4-5 years with medium to heavy use (I use my Macbook for 8-9 hours per day every day) and don't want to spend anything on maintenance Go buy it.

It's been 7 months i have been using it, it never hanged till date and performance is great as compare to windows . For windows user who are facing issues with chrome, they will definitely go in love with this laptop. Battery backup is also good, it gives around 8-9 hrs of backup, if you are continuously working on it. Overall it's a good package, just go for it ."
1184,5,"I was little bit hesitant while buying it but since my wife loves Apple a lot, so it was the best gift option for me on her birthday. she was awfully struck with surprise while unboxing the pack.I have happily migrated from Windows to Mac now, its robust, stylish and exorbitant speed. perfect purchase.

1187,5,"After using Windows for more than a decade, I started using iPad. Impressed by the user friendliness of iPad I bought macbook air.  Pros: Very light, Long battery life (about one day of use), User friendly, very stable system (does not hang or crash), very good sound and picture quality, good metallic built, the experience of the mac ecosystem (iPad+macbook+iPod) is simply mind blowing (specially the air drop feature).

The Build quality is premium which we expect from Apple. 2. The person who wants to install IDE's for development purpose, these IDE's run extremely well and this laptop is also good for video editing purpose. 3.

1190,5,"awesomeness is the word. awesome speed, awesome battery, awesome multi tasking, awesome (light) weight, awesome touch pad (no use of mouse reqd)"
1191,4,"Good laptop. For people who have normal use like for office. This is perfect. However, battery could have improved more. Charger cable get torn after few months, would recommend people to buy spiral band to avoid any wear and tear in cable."
1192,5,Got it in 47000 in Big Billion Sale 2018. Being a Windows user I must say MacBook is amazing. Initially it might feel a little odd in getting comfortable with the UI but once you are comfortable nothing stops you. A Linux user can easily familiarize himself with the OS. Boot Time and Battery backup is the best part. Storage size is a bit of a concern.
1193,5,"no matter what, Macbook is always way ahead of its competitors in case of performance. Although screen is not a retina display but far far better then other windows laptops. Good for daily light usage. Fast to boot and easy to use. You can also do light weight development as well. Works absolutely fine with IntelliJ."
1194,5,"Amazing product. I got it for my development and believe me it works so well with Android studio, jet brains ide. Till now no performance issues."
1195,4,"First, Flipkart is just too good at delivery! Product is perfect. Bought it in a hurry in the festive sale, as Apple raised the price of even the old model of Air by 17k. Overall. The product is good, handles office level multitasking pretty well. Though I had two instances of a slight lag for 3 seconds... (I had 25 application windows open at that Time). Typing is a breeze, adjust the keyboard setting ls to your speed, and it's great. The fluid design of the OS is known to all. Battery stan..."
1196,2,"Display sucks, battery life is great, portable enough so don't think of weight, battery life good enough you don't have to carry n charger everytime"
1197,5,"The product is insane. Superb speed and finesse both in terms of looks and in terms of performance. For people who fear they worked kn windows their entire life and now mac might be difficult, go buy it man.. nothing like that..you can learn it in a day..its amazing.. worth buying at this amazing price.."
1198,5,"So much Happy.. The Macbook Air is good and premium.The most youtube review says its display and viewing angles are bad but its not true.its having decent display look good,if you are moving from Windows to Mac using 30-40k windows laptop then you cant have any single complain.Besides the storage you can use an external Hard Drive for storing moving and extra stuff for normal storing purpose its great with required software in it. I so happy to get this device."
1199,5,"It's an Apple product so rest assured your not going to be disappointed even the slightest, great battery life, nice display, smooth Mac OS, can do casual gaming, top notch creativity machine. Fast delivery by Flipkart and great customer support. Money spent well"
1200,5,"It was very well packaged and delivered on time. Works like a dream, boots in seconds, even faster than some phones! Very smooth and is really good for web browsing, watching movies, light video and photo editing- that means you can edit vlogs easily in HD quality. Happy with the battery backup lasts close to 5-6 Hrs depending on the usage. Really happy that I didn‚Äôt buy windows at the same price!  Go for it, you won‚Äôt regret this super light robust laptop!"
1201,5,"Product is good. Very thin, light weight and portable. Although storage is very less only 98gb available from 120gb. Only 2 usb port. Charging adaptor is very handy easy to cary.  Editing the review after updating to big sur, it really lagging now. A windows laptop with ssd is much better than MacBook, because in future updates there are not going to slow down there machines intentionally. So that user buy the new one. Not value for money."
1202,5,"My Review after one month of usage. I would like to say Awesome product, Awesome Service, Awesome Delivery. Thank you Flipkart, Apple and Ekart Logistics as well."
1203,5,"It's awesome. I was waiting to buy this from long time. Finally I bought it at very good price 43k, thanks Flipkart sale.  For 43k I got MacBook air 2017. MacOS will blow ur mind.

1210,5,"I have been using macbook pro since 2 year. Now on flipkart exchanged with this macbook air at first glance it's pretty good looking device, thin, very light, attractive. Performance is good. Best part is TouchPad, smooth operating system which makes it different. People will say I'm using macbook so I'm telling all good about it but i sah try and see ur self. It's very nice to have a basic light weight and pretty good laptop."
1211,5,it's just a nice product

1215,5,"Superb machine for entry level computing. Unless you are too much obsessed with Windows OS, it is time to shift to MAC OS and it works great. Yes you can not run pirated softwares on Mac. But it is worth a try."
1216,5,Best product at best price
1217,2,It's is quite good n really amazing at 45k budget I love this product but delivery is very late. Battery backup is super very slim n well design n compacted

Performance is not good after using a week. sound quality is average color is average most bad thing is its keypad. as i am using mackbook pro there is a lot difference in keypad. just buy if you ...
1219,5,I have been an apple fan for the last 20 years and continue to be one.  The MAC Air has been a long cherished need for my work and it fits in well. The form factor and functionality is enviable.  With the numerous apps that are available. It is indispensable as a working tool.
1220,5,"I had planned to buy this during the Big Billion Day Sale. With special discount on cards etc. i got a great deal. Now if one can compare it with any other windows laptops from good brands, this is cheaper or almost equivalent. But user experience from this product is butter smooth. Have been using since Oct '2018. No complaint. I have switched, in fact, from windows to Mac OS and found why people prefer Mac. And, thanks to Flipkart for making the product affordable."
1221,5,without a doubt I trust Flipkart. such a wonderful product received in perfect packing. @ just 49990 on big billion day. No one can beat this price. In Apple store it was available for 69500. Thank you Flipkart.

1280,5,"simply. the best laptop. using it for general purpose as well as python programming. has been a delight so far with quick battery charge. ease of use ,sleek looks and amazing performance"
1281,5,"Pros-: Super smooth. Awesome performance and much better experience than any high end windows PC. I am running cloudera Hadoop without any issues. Battery lasts for at least 10-12 hours. Web cam is average.  Cons-:  Only down side is display which is ideal for web surfing or coding but difference arises when you watch movies or videos.  Highly recommend for working professionals, coders, internet surfing etc. But not for gamers or watching movies."
1282,5,"Purchased it a month ago. So far going extremely well. Performance is mind blowing. Touch, screen quality and other aspects are good as per the apple standards. Overall worth product to buy!! - - - - Its been 2 years now and laptop is still working pretty smooth"
1283,5,Best for Travel.....very Handy and stylish.... best battery life .... last nearly for 10 to 12 hrs for normal use....
1284,5,"Honest review. Well, the name is enough ofcourse. Works pretty fine as long as you work normally. Laga at times opening large files. For the first 6months the battery backup was like 10-11hours but now its like 5-6 hours max. Heats up like a burner if you work while charging. Got this for 44500 , yeah okay its so so."
1285,5,"No doubt, an excellent laptop. if your preference is portability and long battery life, I think this is the best you can ever find. I am comfortably getting more than 12 hours continuous-usage battery back up. Also the charging is very fast. It hardly takes 1.5 hours for full charging from less than 10% to 100%. I need not specifically say anything else, since Apple is always known for making elegant products."
1286,5,I Love Apple Products it is perfect match for my old I phone 5s and redmi note 4 this is awesome slick laptop and very beautiful
1287,5,"Its awesome. Use it to feel it . Switched from windows to Mac. Great UI . Handy ,simple , lovely product. Apple continues to prove itself unique, best. Flipkart delivery is fast ."

Android studio and xcode runs smoothly without lag. Even emulator of Android studio runs very smoothly. 5. Mag safe port is really good thing.  cons:- 1. Its i5 5th gen which is very old. 2. Display is small but that cannot be considered as cons.  if all pros are there then why just 3 üåü? Because I feel my device is defe...
1297,4,"I would be just unbiased and honest here. This is an Apple product, so definitely it's accessories and Softwares which you'd buy are also gonna be a bit on the higher side of the scale. With 13.3 Inch of size, LCD screen (which is far better than those yesteryear LCDs), this is a hefty pricing product. But hey, Apple is really good at giving you a Year of Warranty despite you buy it through an Apple Retailer/Reseller or through an online Reseller like Flipkart does. Though the latter one give..."

1308,5,"This is the best budget Apple laptop one can get. Pretty light weight and great for everyday use. I have another pro - so 128 GB was good enough in my case. However, I would suggest 256 GB to be at a comfortable spot. Performs just great and battery life is excellent."

1310,5,First time purchaser of an apple product. MacBook is an excellent laptop. No matching no comparisons with its counterparts. Very powerful machine can do most of ur task easily. Well aluminium built body but very light to carry anywhere. Performance is excellent. Battery backup is also very gud . With my first charge I used it for a week. Very satisfied with the product. Apple product standards are unmatched in the market.
1311,5,"Very Efficient Device. Apple devices have strong integration between hardware and software hence even with lower specs on paper, it outperform windows running hardware. This Mac is good enough for daily activity, running programming IDE, emulators etc. Not meant for heavy duty gaming, but 8gb of RAM can handle moderate gaming as well. Most Amazing feature is battery life, unparalleled even when compared to macbook pro. I get 10+ hrs on moderate usage on single charge. Was a steal at 45k, a we..."

Hard disk only 128 GB But these cons are not that sig...
1316,4,Happy with the product & packing was good .  if ur looking for a Sleek and portable laptop with efficient battery then this one is a good pick. Display though is a bit on the lower side unlike the Apple retina display.  Also consider that the laptop doesnt have any lan port or hdmi port.we need to separately purchase the thunderbolt2 converters.The actual apple prices are proced above 1500 bucks.   Purchased it on big billonday sale for a decent price.

1449,1,"The rating given is based on the experience I had. Bought this product on Big billion day Oct'19, within a week I had to take it to service center. Issues I faced was - 1. Heating. 2. Not booting and showing black screen. 3. And finally it stopped working and not able to switch it on."
1450,1,Not worth it to buy such a overly priced and overy hyped device. Its repairing costs more than the actual CP. This is horrible. Had to shed another 45000 for repairing its logic board.

Another apple brand so classic ,so elegant and beautiful. all rumours with this are just wastefull. awesome build quality, look , screen ,work absolutely flowless.  switching myself from window to macbook. Great product by apple at such price. five star."
1452,3,"A very nice laptop but is overpriced.The maintenance is too damn high.I bough this in 2018 and in 2 years this laptop broke down two times,both during june july month.The service centre told it's a common problem with macbook air.The first time it crashed it was still in warranty period and hence was repaired for free. But let me tell you after purchasing a laptop worth 60k you don't want to repair it again at a cost of at least 40k. Coming to design and performance both are awesome. But if y..."

Not a reliable seller. i bought it from Truecom retail and was sold by sane retails pvt ltd from telangana. when i checked the serial number of the macbook for warranty status on apple website, it showed purchase date not validated and serial number was not mentioned in the invoice. hence it was not showing 1 yr warranty.

1476,5,"Its Mac so no need to tell anything about the product. But I must tell about Flipkart. delivery was fast, nicely packed. after two months all of a sudden my mac charger stop working, may be my bad luck. I contacted flipkart customer care and got immediate response that as i am still under warrenty so I shall get free service from icare. I contacted icare and you cant believe they have replaced the charger COMPLETELY FREE OF COST!! so it is myth that online product doesnot comes with warranty."
1477,5,After 2 months : I can definitely assure you that you'll not be returning to the windows again after using mac... Everything is so simple and very well managed... Strongest point is it's battery... Sometimes I've got 14-15 hours of battery backup... In 60 days of usage I've just charged it 22 times (Voila! Yes you can see the number of times you've charged your Mac)...I would definitely recommend it to everyone because I'm really happy with my MacBook... I've recommended it to many of my frie...
1478,5,"First of all thanks to flipkart for big billion day and quick delivery. Got the product for 43500/-, one of the best deal.  No doubt that machine performs well. No heating issues and quite easy to carry around. Good battery backup as well. If may feel a bit of difficulty in using the machine initially is you are from a windows world. But it just takes few hours to familiarize and then you will enjoy the ride"
1479,1,This is my first apple product and I bought this laptop on exchange with the my old hp laptop. My experience on very first day few keys are not working and I reached out to the Flipkart and they gave me response stating to visit and nearest mac service center. There is no replacement for the product and the solution for this fix is they need to replace whole keyboard. I am not happy because at the end I will be getting the repaired product and not the new one. ...
1480,5,Its the latest MacBook air model (128GB) and imported in India in August 2017. Its enthralling to use it. The performance is glitch free. Do buy if you are looking for a sleeky laptop.

I gave it enough number of chances but it just doesn't deserve anything. The laptop crashed Four times and the engineer at the service center now says that the motherboard is faulty.

1532,5,amazing and so nice and slim laptop.
1533,5,"I was a skeptic regarding Mac. Why is it so costly? Turns out, you get exactly what you pay for. A premium looking laptop with great quality and battery life. After using this for a day, I became a fan of it. And to those people who complain about the display. They are complaining because they used the latest Macbook Pro varients. But when we compare it with other windows laptops, It's display is amazing. The best unexpected part is its Sound quality. It is just mind blowing. I never came acr..."

But about Macbook Air 2017 model, let me confess, even though the hardware is quite satisfactory, Mac OS is not up to the mark. First and foremost issue is, its OS is not user friendly like iphone OS. It is hell and heaven difference between Mac OS (Mojave) and iphone OS. Sound quality, form factor, battery even display is very good. You can easily use But you will have to struggle to get a simple thing done. I do not f..."

1543,5,Okay it felt little harder for me to use MacBook Air as i switched from windows to macOS. The display was just too small I thought when it got delivered but after using & realised performance I Thought its not windows lol to give 15-16 inch screens

1545,5,I had lots of doubt about the macbook and apple products on flipkart. 1) whether i will get the original or duplicate product but after getting the product my this doubt got clear. I received the seal packed product and i verified my warranty details also on the apple website. 2) As i was switching from Windows laptop to macbook laptop. So i was worried about whether i would be able to install all the application which i was using on windows laptop. As i need laptop for the programming so n...
1546,1,"Mojave is very slow. In the flipkart link, it says Sierra, but the one I got is Mojave. Performance is not as expected. Rest all good."
1547,1,"It seemed to be a very good deal initially. It worked perfectly for few months. However, screen got damaged due to water. Apple store was asking for 44k to replace screen. Got it replaced from outside in 22k. System used to hang multiple times. Who says apple devices don't hang. They do. Finally, the worst part, charging issue. Device doesn't charge."
1548,5,Amazing product. Got for 49990 in big billion sales. Good delivery. Thanks flipkart.
1549,2,It work slow
1550,1,"This product came as defective from the inside (which common man can not see from the first eye). When it ran into error mode I visited The Apple store to fix the errors, Apple store replied to me that the product has a circuit damaged which can not come under warranty. I paid extra Rs. 7000 to fix that problem.  Terrible seller."
1551,5,Buttery smooth performance and premium design! Beautifully made and also powerful at the same time! Apple's optimization of power and memory is just unmatchable! Battery lasts quite long and sleep mode doesn't consume even a percentage of battery! Definitely recommended!
1552,5,"It's blazingly fast, user friendly ( if you are a windows user then you need to spend couple of hours on first day) , slik."
1553,1,It stopped working after 15 days of purchase. It opens up and then everything becomes black and nothing is working even after pressing power button while the charger is connected. Sometimes apple logo appears and then again it went dead.
1554,4,"BBD best deal as got it in 37590 with exchange of my old laptop. Although it's old model but in terms of usability, performance, design, battery backup, sound, overall everything is excellent, decent enough for daily usage. it's a steal deal Apple MacBook Air rocks."
1555,1,The trackpad of my new MacBookAir doesn't work or respond to a click. And it's not even a day but Flipkart won't take it and instead asks me to visit Apple centre. After sales service doesn't exist here. What distress!
1556,5,Excellent machine. No laptop can beat it.
1557,5,"I am writing this review after 1 year of purchase......  1. Delivery of product by Flipkart - Excellent. 2. Item delivered - No doubt, excellent.  Overall excellent product by Apple, as always....."
1558,5,I am using it for 3 years. So far the best experience with Apple.

1568,5,"While purchasing, I was a bit sceptical because of the specs of the laptop. But believe me, this laptop runs fast. Just keep in mind donot open too many Tabs of google chrome. The laptop had increased my productivity since it forces me to do one task at a time. Display is not that good. It will keep reminding you how old this model is. Other than that, this model is good for development work."
1569,4,so good
1570,5,It is the best laptop at the price 54990/-
1571,5,If you are looking for a laptop where you can do your creative things this is the best one.  Not for gamers.

1651,2,Came with a bad battery life. Dies pretty quickly.
1652,5,Good packaging and fast delivery. Great product
1653,3,Battery backup not more than 3hr
1654,1,stopped working in 15 days
1655,1,Very bad quality
1656,3,Its a decent product...go for it only if u have a budget constraint....cant be used for full day use the system gets little heated up on full day usage. The delivery takes a long time ...it took almost a month for me. After many many customer calls.
1657,4,"Good product, but those who want to use tally or any other windows software, might need to do some struggle.  The lack of Numpad might be felt.  But those who want it for editing purpose, blogging/vlogging, etc. then it‚Äôs just perfect for you."

1659,5,Display quality is just awesome and the design is very beautiful and battery backup are the best
1660,5,"Product is some what over hyped but well is good,thin and compact in size, the multi gesture touch pad is amazing"
1661,1,The worst product I have purchased in my life. Mother board corrupted in less than 2 years. I had to replace it for 20k. This is worst than a Chinese product. They are looting u on the basis of name only. It's better to buy HP product. Atleast they cost less and work fine for years.
1662,5,Died in a year and 10 months!
1663,5,Complete laptop for professional use..
1664,5,Very nice... Looks original..
1665,4,"Its A power house friends , use this if u r a developer and User , plzzz gamers stay away , batter is awesome ! Everything is good"
1666,4,No doubt it's an amazing product. But the laptop started switching off without power on. Then I had to goto the service enter and they found the connection to the battery inside the laptop was loose and hence it was not charging. Didn't expect this from an apple product.
1667,3,Warranty problems

1719,5,"As I have to work on Android studio. Its performance is quite well. You can even open two instances of studio even though you don't feel a glitch or hang like in Windows. As it's new, for it's long lasting review we have to wait for a year. Only one issue is it's less memory i.e 128 hard disk. It's ssd that's good. If you have a portable hardrive then it's ok."
1720,5,"i think that this is one of the best product Apple has made. Thanks to Steve Jobs.  Display is good. There are many people who complain that it is not good compared to newer models but it gets all the things done without any hassle. For the rest, everything is best."

1746,5,"This is one of the best buys from Flipkart. Transferring from Windows to Mac was a bit difficult but with little bit of YouTube tutorials, I now use it like a pro!Never going back to windows. Although I could do with a higher resolution web cam."
1747,5,Awesome
1748,4,Product was genuine but 1 star reduced for slow delivery. I expected 2 day delivery but Flipkart took 4 days to deliver it.
1749,5,Apple is Apple. No One one can beat it  Pros: Best battery life Negligible boot time Powerfull machine Sleek and premimum design  Cons: Less storage but that can be overcome by having external Hard disk. Not for hardcore gaming  P.S: Purchased at Rs:45k  So if your budget is less than 50k go for it!
1750,5,sexy and hot
1751,3,Getting os corrupted message frequently when turned on!! rest is good
1752,5,Positive 1.Battery back up is very good. 2.Very slim body 3.Power efficient Negative 1.xls file takes some time to open but after installing Microsoft office there is no problem. 2.You have to install application for file transfer from android phone
1753,5,"Nothing more to say. It's Apple. First trillion dollar company. I loved it. I use it daily for work, video editing, programming, and so on. The delivery was delayed due to big billion day sales. It was delivered in good condition. Although one cons is it gives shocks when connected to charger. The shock is not noticeable so it's not a dealbreaker. Other than charging time, it doesn't gives a shock."

1790,5,"No words to describe, loved the product."
1791,2,The flap just falls back if you open it a bit more than a right angle. Happens for all the Macs ordered through Flipkart.
1792,5,Fine refurbished design with minimal touch and the amazing blend with mac os Sierra. Although the processor is quite behind of time.
1793,5,"My MacBook Air delliverd in time on 15 May 18, with multiple offers, thanks to flipkart and retailnet for their support."

1799,5,"I am writing this review after 8 days and really mesmarized about this product. Very thin and light. If you are a windows user then most certainly you would find some difficulty in Mac OS. Other than that hardware configuration, look and feel is unbeatable within the price range with regards to other products.  Regarding delivery, delivered my product before the said date. I bought two same laptop for me and for my spouse."
1800,5,No need to tell that it is really good. Worth its price.

1807,5,I had lot of doubts before buying it.. but I am fully satisfied with it...works like a dream...very sleek...fast and stylish go for it you won't regret
1808,5,The Laptop is too good. If you want middle range macbook you can go for it. The package from filpkart is also upto the mark. Battery backup is solid. You have to purchased Office 360 for microsoft word and excel. Also you can update new software update. Just go for it you'll not regret..    Only thing is Rom 128GB but if you have external hard disk then its not that much problem. I'm using this macbook with 1TB HDD
1809,5,"Excellent product!! Got it for 41k including discounts, exchange, cashback...price made it sweeter!! Performance wise, i just felt resolution should have been more. Rest all good."

1820,5,Good packaging After 5 day of use I will say that it's a little beast that beats windows based machine in every aspect. It's rightly said. First impression is the last impression. I got it for 45k in big billion day sale. It's worth. Don't hesitate just go for it.
1821,5,It's divert before .. packing was quite good .. Manufacturing 2017 Aug i was worry about that but it's recent model ..

1825,5,Very good product ...great changeover for Me from Windows to Mac... way to go with Mac...
1826,5,Impressive!!!
1827,5,Who else got it for 38K :D
1828,1,"Within two months it's stopped, I try to on but it not working"
1829,5,"Too confused to write any review. The product do not have any issues. But there is a but that I am unable to explain myself. So decision is all yours if you want go for it, if you do not want don't go for it."
1830,5,"Itz have been 90 days after buying this. Such a awesome product.. No drawbacks.. High performance,No lagging,No battery issues,10 hour battery backup,no charger problem.. üîπOnly problem is charger will heat much more we can prepare Tea or Omelet with this heat üòÅ. Just with one word about this Mac is """" Beast""""."
1831,5,This is one of the best MacBook from Apple. Even it is performing much better than the latest version of MacBook Air.
1832,2,If you want to buy it for that Apple logo and amazing build quality it will be a great buy... the problem is actually in mac os... If you switching from windows to mac( in this case you most probably are) you are actually downgrading in terms of os.. Mac is no where close to windows... You will feel cramped you won't find lots of handy options... Dragging is such a mess... And lot of such problems... That even you get familiar with the os you are going to miss tha windows os.
1833,5,nice prodect
1834,5,This machine is great...for everyone except gamer....you see the specs are not so good as per price but the performance is better then i7 16 gb ram Windows laptop
1835,5,product.... is good.... i bought this mac at 45k recently....i dont know the real price exactly may be 60k or 70k....so guys out there wait for proper time and bye it.... If ur confuse buying mac 17 or other laptop -gamer these mac isnt for u -storage is low.... bt it dsnt matter me much coz i use for only for study purpose jst by saving pic n documents or any study matetial....i use it for watching movie.... later i delete that movie....these is how i save my storage *if u want to known more...
1836,5,nice product.fast deliver....love it
1837,5,"Laptop is super good, there is no need for a r view. But one main thing is seller's packing. It was packed carelessly with some Buble wrap pieces here and there. Apple's boxing for the MacBook was in bad shape when delivered. A simple footwear deserves better packing"
1838,1,Ok ok don‚Äôt worth it
1839,5,If you want apple you can buy this.  If you want laptop which will be useful for coding video editing and other stuff choose other brands   Apple is selling 10 rupees product for 1000 price with apple logo.
1840,1,"Very,very disappointing. Was expecting top-notch performance but found quite a lot of issues making it a deplorable experience for me. I moved from Windows for a better experience but clearly, it was a mistake."
1841,4,"go for it in 2020 or 2021...Why not...??? It is batter than windows i7 and most of i5 super fast, world class designe, super display, long battery Once you use, you love mac OS I wiil get it only 45k in BBD 10/10/2018"
1842,1,Wrong please don't place order from this side or application it's worthless.. I purchased mackbook i5 but I saw a lot scratches in display after opening... So please don't purchase any apple product from this application (Flipkart)
1843,1,the battery is draining very fast even with just internet surfing
1844,1,It is not so good as I thought before buying. Speed is almost same. Only you boast of brand name. It not so user friendly. Ms office is not there.
1845,1,Good product but price varies
1846,1,I bought a macbook air 2017 and it gives reapeated shocks while switching it on... It has some serious heating issues.. And guess what.. IT GOT STUCK AND DOESNT MOVE. AND THE ARROW KEYS FOESNT WORK ANYMORE!!!
1847,2,"don't buy this Laptop, the Mac Book Air very bad quality parts, this should be repair after 10 month or 15 months, the repair cast near 43000/- , if you ready pay next 43K , you will buy , or should be buy extend warrant , if not don't buy this Mac book. I am not understand the Big Apple product is very bad."
1848,3,Great
1849,2,Pathetic product delivered by flipkart. Charger stopped working after 7 months and even the mousepad. System shuts down abnormally. No response taken by flipkart so far after sending multiple emails. Waste of money and mentally harassing.
1850,1,Don't buy in 2019 they give you 2017 model
1851,1,Damage product send so I suggest do not buy.
1852,3,Still using it almost like 1 year  Battery is best in the work   Rayanmotovlog summer vlog YouTube
1853,4,Amazing quality

1855,5,Very nice products.
1856,5,Good but price high
1857,1,"I have purchase this product before 1 year 4 months ago, but now it is dead. When i go at apple repair center then they asked me around 42000Rs for fix the issue in my Macbook air, But before one year when i was purchase this at cost 64000Rs... This is wrost product that i have purchase in my life.... please do not purchase this product... This is waste of money....."
1858,5,Perfect
1859,5,Awesome product Thanks Flipkart Delivered also in Lockdown period .
1860,4,I have bought this for 51K. best price and best choice.
1861,1,"Not as good as other model of mac book air, motherboard get crash in just 4month."
1862,5,As seen and shown in product image display exactly same product arrived. Highly recommended to put a screen guard along with the skin cover for any further scratch on the body of the product Otherwise too good product to use.
1863,5,"product is awesome as it is Apple products , but taking from. Flipkart is not good"
1864,1,don't buy MacBook from flipkart
1865,5,"Awesome price, Awesome product, Value for money. Flipcart delivered BEFORE time. Thanks a ton."
1866,5,Hi Team Battry Bacup not giving
1867,1,charget not found
1868,4,All are good but large excel files are not open in number application. Need to download MS office for work . Only this the main problem otherwise its a mind blowing product
1869,5,"Awesome product, I bought this laptop on Big billion days, I got for 50k, wherein there was extra 10% off on only HDFC card which I didn't possess, so have to bear the pain of paying extra 5k.  product is worth of paying so much and also performance is good, if your thinking to buy personal laptop for atleast 2 - 3 years without any hassle then this is the right product."
1870,2,I think window is better system Crashes
1871,4,product is good and is performing well with latest OS Packing was very good and delivered safe..
1872,5,Very nice product apple MacBook air
1873,5,Superb product
1874,2,Nice but build quality of macbook air is not as robust as before. Backplate knocks when u hold it in hands. It knocks continuously when u use it in bed or Diwan cot. Absolutuley annoying for this half lakh worth product.
1875,3,"Pros Delivery on time. Awesome laptop in terms of speed, performance, battery back is just superlative..runs thru the day on a single charge even a mobile phone battery doesnt last as long in most cases.  Cons But the laptop screen hinge is loose, on minor movement of the laptop the screen flips back. one of the usb port has some issue, two clips/strips of metals in it are not in line with the slot and therefore difficult to insert pen drive/hdd."
1876,5,The macmachine is awesome but the delivery by Ekart logistic was pathetic.The delivery guy named Ramakant was rude that can not be expressed.Only in Indian companies this kind of employees can be seen.Foreign companies will not hire such kind of staff who will destroy the fame and image of the brand towards the customer.
1877,1,Product is not user friendly no lan port at all. More over the return scheme from Flipkart not allow you to return if u r not satisfied.
1878,4,1 star cut for non availability of CD player in MacBook otherwise awsum
1879,5,My love..... Simply awesome performance new macbook air 2017
1880,5,Small and elegant laptop that can carry anywhere you want. Powerful machine. Awesome design
1881,5,Amazing machine. Absolutely love using the MacBook.Great battery backup.Very advanced engineering is involved in this machine.Just go for it.
1882,5,Stunningly superb
1883,1,I buy this one here on flipkart on oct 17 th i have warntry i didnt use much also but the apptronix guy is saying that it is liquid damage warrantry wont cover wrost product ever dont buy any apple products on online
1884,1,Don't buy these expensive items from Flipkart rather go to store and get new sealed pack from them after a week of purchase it started getting automatically turnedoff due to add error I don't know what the fraud being done by the Flipkart or their seller it haven't worked great my colleagues also have same and it is working fine even after 2 years . And Flipkart don't even provide replacement for these if something bad happens .
1885,1,MAC is not for India because most of supporting app and software are not working with mac operating system. Therefore apple should bring laptop with window Microsoft or substitute of Mac so that we can use. otherwise it is only box. Another point I want to add that b2 b GST invoice is not issuing to customer. Although they are charging GST. not issuing of B2B GST invoice is red alert...??
1886,1,bettery performance not upto the mark
1887,4,It's a good product but not value for money
1888,5,It's performance is so consistent and optimised.. it is almost unbelievable.. it performs better than my pc with i5 10th gen
1889,4,"Happy with product, but have issues on battery backup... Soon I will visit apple store... But I think flipkart member can look this matter seriously.. For future improvements"
1890,5,"the best option for the ones looking to buy a machine with a good battery backup and do editing and stuff. It's overall good for everything, if it's a movie or music, it will fit well. Yes, you can't play games, its a mac. other than that, it wont disappoint you."

1902,1,This macbook started giving problem after few months and after around 8 months i stopped all of a sudden. when i went to apple customer care they opened it and found one rust dot on mother board though there was no liquid spill or physical damage. initially i was told it is not covered in warranty but After few calls with customer care they considered it a design issue and replaced the motherboard in warranty. I bought apple products in USA too and never faced any quality or service issue. Se...

But, this product is very precise in every manner (convince, battery backup, processor speed, look, adepter). Only one thing i.e. storage space is little bit small. Rest is fine. At this price ( 58000 Rs) this product is nice."

1956,5,Loved the product. Everything is cool about this laptop. I got macbook air with laminating apple logo design at the back of display. I liked it
1957,4,Though it's an old version but working well. Switching from Window to Mac was completely new experience but loved it. My daughter is enjoying her online class from mobile to Mac... Camera and sophisticated charger still a concern but overall deserve ****
1958,3,ROM is less due to which it run slow.
1959,5,This is the last macbook that you can buy which can be repaired by outside technician. I got my old one repaired 3 times. The newer macbooks are literally unrepairable by third parties. So if you are buying a macbook and do not want to spend extra with apple guys. go for this one.

For coding and business purpose this is a powerful machine. Video editing up to HD can be done easily but 1080p,4k is not preferable on this laptop. Not suitable for games."

2025,4,"It's awesome heating should be resolve, otherwise all is well"
2026,5,The product is no doubt superb but the exchange policy of Flipkart is worst. I had a very bad experience this time. Even I plan to cancel the order. The wish master or the guy who come for exchange is only giving 2000/- of my old laptop where as I am expecting 8500/- for the exchange value. The guy later confirm that we never give customer to there desired value. Finally I end up with cash value for the order and plan to sell my old laptop myself
2027,5,No comments !! It's a macbook !!!!!
2028,5,Value for money

2060,5,Better than any laptop in the market ..it's apple bro..blindly go for it .. windows are not able to beat apple ..it's have a i5 old processor but believe me it's better than i5 10 th gen.. premium build with classy looks..just go for it

2100,5,I have macbook Pro from organization but let me tell you this product is no less. Apple touch and feel is amazing. It may be 10k costly than other I5 products like dell etc but worth it.
2101,5,"A macbook at this price is a steal but it's not useful for anything other than light browsing, working on ms office (will have to spend extra on that) and other light applications. This is a 2017 model with an older gen processor. It might get Big Sur but any update beyond that is a question mark. Also the display tech is very old. However, The build quality and light weightedness is better than even double priced windows ones. If you are light user and and a new/old apple convert then go for..."
2102,5,Good timely delivery by Flipkart
2103,5,"Always wanted to buy a MacBook. Purchased for 59k.  Although the model runs down to 2017, still worth every penny in 2020.  Comes updated with latest Mac OS Catalina 10.15."

Display very bad with HD resolution. UI very bad to Me l, Windows 10 is best. Latest OS Catalina pre-installed. Usable SSD above 80GB. 8GB DDR3 Ram. Intel core i5 5th gen with intel graphics.

2123,5,Beautiful
2124,5,After using for more than 6 months I can say the product is good. Good for normal uses and weather home or office. In this price the product is good..but if some one looking for best Processor more than i5 Or long video edits or longer time cpu usage may this will not meet you requirements.
2125,5,"Read it carefully!  Before going to buy a Laptop full with new specifications, just remember one thing; ""Apple sabka baap hai"". My Macbook Air was manufactued on September, 2020 and the best part is it comes with Mac OS Catalina. I upgraded it to Mac OS Big Sur. Believe me, there is even no lag while even importing or exporting videos in iMovies (jo nhi jante ho, yea KineMaster ka baap hai, apple ka apna in-built app).

2164,5,I am happy. This device is really good. Design was really very cool. Light weight. I love this.
2165,4,Purchased during Flipkart Big Billion Days 2020. No doubt mac is always a best choice as far as it's performance is concerned. Found only 2 cons. 1. Battery is giving hardly 6 hrs backup. I was expecting minimum 8 hrs backup with my limitation usage as browsing and YouTube. 2. Adapter gets heated very high whenever I charged in 1 shot from 10% to 90% .  Rest everything is Good.
2166,4,Awsm!

2191,4,"There is absolutely no comparison between MAC & Windows. This is the best operating system in terms of performance, durability & battery backup which is very well complemented by it's asthetics.  Packaging is top notch (as expected)  What is astonishing for me is the delivery time and below average customer service. This is indeed an area worth looking at. Hope Flipkart take necessary actions to ensure product should reach within the date of commitment."
2192,5,Amazing
2193,5,Good perched
2194,5,One if the best purchase
2195,5,Excellent!I'm a windows laptop user.wanted something sturdy.bought this.does the job well.one needs to buy office365 separately!comes with OS catalina. I'm not sure if 128 GB would be enough for everyone so an additional storage expense should be kept in mind.battery back up is good.
2196,2,After 6 months of use the laptop gets overheated so much and lags also.Also tally doesn't work in this.The battery in the start is so amazimg but after 6 months of use it drains like heavy rain.
2197,1,Quality of display is worst.... No clarity of pic... It look like old time smartphones display

2200,5,"Loved it!  Delivery executive was way too generous and soft spoken. Both, product and flipkart services (seller inclusive) are superb. Packaging was outstanding. Keep up the good work. Thanks for your service!"
2201,5,I got a recent and Aug manufactured Macbook and not from old stock. Only problem I can see in 15 days usage is that the power adapter/brick is getting very hot while charging despite it being the new MagSafe 45W power adapter. I raised the issue with Apple Care but yet to get any satisfactory resolution.

2208,1,Honestly speaking . It's a very good laptop . Even in 2020 it's worth it. Battery life and sound quality is very awesome. Performance level too good . If your requirement is for professional or education use then must buy. If your requirement is for gaming then must be avoided.
2209,1,"It's dead less than 2 years later despite very basis usage. Even the apple support centre isn't able to fix it despite charging 35k. Would recommend not buying. If you do, pls add on the extra insurance."

2211,5,Buyed it during Big Billion Days. Performance is awesome and boot up very quickly. Battery last for something like 11 hours with wifi on and surfing at medium Brightness. Display should have been better. But Sound quality is just superb.

2240,3,This apple macbook air nice in design. One cons is heating issue in bottom. During charging i was seeing online movie then bottom of laptop & charger is being more heated than as usual. This must not happen with premium company's laptop.

2277,5,I brought it in big billion days of 55000 rupees. I am the lucky one who get it in 2019 as apple upgrade Mac book air in 2020 and now old version is not produce by company. This is best Mac book for students. None of windows laptop can beat the performance of this Mac book in same cost. And of course Mac operating system is more powerful as compared to windows in terms of coding or video editing.
2278,5,Worthy of money
2279,5,Awesome apple product. But I don't know how it's possible. I got sealed box but when I opened it I have found some scratches on the charger.

2287,5,Superb quality ‚ù§Ô∏è it
2288,5,Reviewing after one year of use. Pros- 1.Best performance and around 7-8 hours battery. 2.Best software experience.

2304,5,The product is up to the mark and with the best performance in the league. But if you have a job of which require much more of connection and sharing then this will be a fussy for you because this require more task for that.
2305,5,"Product is good but never buy on HDFC EMI‚Äôs option either HDFC or FLIPCART is cheating,Deducted 4 extra EMI‚Äôs and now they are blaming on each other"
2306,5,Macbook air is awesome.

But suddenly it stopped booting properly, showed battery and heating issues. Tried resolving the issue by doing smc reset but it didn't work.

2335,4,Serial number in tax invoice and actual serial number are different. Having issue to register its warranty.  Rest everything is good.
2336,4,The laptop is beautifully designed and slick. The UI is very comfortable but the apple environment is still growing so there can be interoperability issues with other windows programs. Recently however I have been facing quality issues and had to pay to change the keyboard. With upgrade to Catalin now am facing wi fi issues. The policy of replacing parts makes maintenance very high. For the premium price we are paying I expected far better quality. So weigh the pros and cons before buying the...

2373,2,Jabar dasth laptop
2374,5,Excellent product & performance
2375,1,Mac Book Air not getting charged. Battery is not working with the adapter. Do not buy from Flipkart. They have fudged. Flipkart has refused return also.
2376,1,Battery problem after 7 month.
2377,5,Kya bolu it's amazing laptop i ever used
2378,4,Product worth the price Good for business purposes only Not good for editing color grading video editing like that because of the display resolution
2379,4,"Best quality, worth of money."
2380,5,A wonderful product.
2381,5,"Nice strong build, unlike the pro model.Only con is there is no in-built HDMI port. I think this is the last model where the apple logo shines."
2382,5,Battery backup and performance makes me happy
2383,5,Still the best laptop if we overlook the big bezzle'e and screen quality. For getting in the Apple Kingdom its the best you can get.
2384,3,"It won‚Äôt turn on after three years from purchase date! Unfortunately, I woke up to start working and finding my MacBook Air not starting. Tried all key combination- started after a couple of hours. But next day onwards- totally conked off. Battery is okay. It‚Äôs basically a three year investment. But performed very well ! Very sad about this."
2385,1,The laptop faced numerous issues 1. Blickering of the screen while watching videos 2. The RAM stopped working within 3.5 months
2386,5,Great laptop even in 2020
2387,5,"Pros: Great for regular use,outstanding battery life, rapid charge, keyboard is smooth, trackpad is smooth, built in 128GB SSD is worth it if you are looking for long term work performance. For 66k, I would really recommend the Air. I have installed Anaconda on it and seems there has been no issue with the background code processing so far. Sound quality is very nice, placement of the speakers really does the trick.  Cons: Power adapter and bottom vent gets heated up very much"
2388,4,Original Trusted
2389,5,Good product I love apple products

2509,5,Great experience.
2510,4,I bought this Laptop on Jan 2020. After 1 month of usage I feel everything is fine except the fonts.The fonts are blurry and pixeleted.After trying many methods i upgraded to Catalina but it did not resolve the issues.Looks like it's an issue with Mojave and Catalina for non-retina display.
2511,5,From 2013 I am using only Lenovo series laptop booted with Linux. Needed a new laptop so opted for this. very surprised with the smoothness the laptop runs.As for the SSD for more storage you can take a external hard disk. Very good buy
2512,4,Worth of money

2514,5,good product at great price

2534,5,what can be better
2535,5,Apple is Awesome As Always. If You Wish To Go Blind üòÄ
2536,5,Overall performance is superb but display is disappointing. If one can manage with inferior display quality than it is a must go laptop at 50k range.
2537,5,"fits well for the price. The quality is hands down amazing. If you carry your laptop a lot, this is a lifesaver. For the purpose of video editing as well, fits perfect!"
2538,4,No worry if You are a professional otherwise it might be little fuzzy but overall only of its kind
2539,5,Value for money.

3096,1,"the product is good, but even if you finds any defect in macbook there is no option to return it on the flipkart, then why to buy on it, it will show the link to copy n paste and you keep running their service center."
3097,4,Good

3120,2,best performance good quality
3121,4,Display panel in this laptop is quiet outmode with 1400x900 pixel panel in the HD bezzelless and 1080 pixel panels. Another con is the hard drive is formatted in fat encryption which makes it a cumbersome task to transfer files from your mac book to other storage devices be it pendrive hard disk etc unless they too are encrypted in fat format. The processing speed is quiet fast battery back up is excellent. Hard disk read and write speed is awesome. The laptop is compact and sleek easy to carry.
3122,5,Awesome product...
3123,5,High performance laptop
3124,5,Macbook Air is working fine.
3125,5,"Please do not purchase any laptop from here. I purchased a MacBook. The serial number is registered in apple the website, 3 months before. And The major problem is they are not mentioning the laptop serial number in the invoice by which you can not avail any service."

And the most amazing feature is trackpad, one can do anything and everything with such trackpad. Mac is for all the users who wish their computer work flowless and respond when they wanted it to be.

3255,5,Tnx
3256,5,It‚Äôs the best MacBook to buy and for ‚Çπ45000 without exchange during big billion days it was a steal because the new one is unnecessarily expensive. Flipkart did a good job and the product I received was brand new without any speculation.

After I went through a couple of you tube tutorials on how to use mac, it is was quite easy for me. Th build quality of the product is awesome. Battery life is superb. Although the display could have been better but it is still value for money.  On the whole a good buy"

3457,4,I am quite disappointed with the way Flipkart handles product exchanges. The laptop that was supposed to be exchanged was in perfect good shape. I am not sure what Flipkart expects to be the standards for an exchange product. A tiny scratch on the screen and the product is rejected.

4343,5,I have just received the laptop today and am very excited to use it.Must say that at this price range it's one of the best laptops to buy without thinking once.Must buy if you want a decent work laptop with good specifications at this price range.
4344,1,Its my review after used after 5 months. Its not a valuable laptop for study or any smooth working purposes. Issues: 1. Connectivity issues I m facing now. Specially usb port. 2. Battary performance was well for first 3 months. After it drains quickly without any playing video or audio. Only pdf reading it running hardly 2 hrs. 3. web camera is very bad performing like 0.3mp. 4. The processor also very slow and sometimes its hanging that one can't move for other work. 5. In sunlight one ...
4345,3,"Just an okay product.. Its a month now and these are my feedback. Performance is okay for people use to surf and watch films. Quality is average.. tapping on mouse pad is like tapping on cardboards. I expected a bit more quality. Few irritants are no capslock light.. u have no idea if the caps is on or not, especially when u type passwords.. other one is the on/off button.. this is just like another key on keyboard without light again.. if the screen lits up only then u could realise the syst..."
4346,5,"Laptop is definitely value for money!! Also the clock speed is little slow but it works perfectly fine for office work, studying and streaming movies/series!. Good laptop at a good price, also this laptop is good if you are a first time buyer. Just so that you all know...I am writing this review after using the laptop for 2 whole days."
4347,5,Laptop is good for kids ..school or secondary laptop for movies and also for older folks who just need connectivity.. like skype and social. For 17k this is a good deal. 1TB for storage and 4GB ram does the light lifting. Dont expect this to do any fancy gaming or programs..what you pay and the purpose is key before selecting this laptop
4348,4,"It is worth laptop who like to prefer to attending online classes, watching movies, simple ms office works.

Display quality is very good.  5. Performance- Good. Little bit slow to open excel those are greater than 1mb.  6. Battery - Not good...

4388,1,"Very slow, not up to the mark...."

4390,4,Full laptop is very good but slow üôÇ
4391,1,The laptop wont start when received. Flipkart has some misleading claims as now they say that replacement will be done only after Asus technician visits and checks the laptop. So one will end up wasting time and will have to deal with unnecessary haggling for no fault except buying a lemon product from Flipkart. Pathetic fine prints policy.
4392,1,Don't waste money on this product. Its very slow. Stop inbetween your work. Takes long time to open file folders everything. Even you can't take online classes properly in one go from this device its takes large time for every action.
4393,1,The price went down after my purchase.
4394,2,slow
4395,5,Good laptop
4396,3,"Overall I would grade it 3/5. Display colours are very dim may be because of anti glaze screen. Storage is pitiable.... even my 7 years old Lenovo has got better storage than it. And the worst thing is that I received the product with two minor dead pixels' line at the bottom, these pixels are visible in the pic just above the logo ...... going to opt for the replacement......."

However, If Asus can reduce the size which will look attractive, whole plastics is been used instead if they could have used metal, that would be essential. In India we all need low cost laptops for school or small business purpose. And a one more feature essential can make this laptop popular is the backlights in the keyboard.  No company pays attention to ..."

Moreover, when I contacted Flipkart to take it back they said it can only be replaced for which they want me to wait 16 days. Please avoid purchasing electronics from flipkart if you love your hard earned money."

I had to buy kingston ddr4 8gb 2666mhz ram for Rs.2500 to actually get this laptop to work as otherwise it would utilize 80-85% ram on just opening a web browser. 8gb is the maximum additional upgrade allowed.

5311,5,"After 6 months, I decided to write up a review. Originally I was skeptical about the laptop as many people said it arrived in a defective condition.  I expected this to last around 5-6 months but it has already outpaced that assuming the reviews, but here's a review I decided to make.  For budget, this is pretty good for some work and light gaming. I occasionally use it for medium-level video editing and it holds well.

5312,4,"I am using this laptop since 1year. No complaints. Running perfectly. But it is little bit slow response. It's because the storage device is hdd which has slow read rate.

Main bottleneck for this laptop is the HDD. Because of hard disk this laptop doesn't feel snappy(AMD is not to be blamed). I recommend Upgrading to SSD or buy a variant with SSD. Display is very good with decent viewing angles. 4 Hours + battery life with fast charging."
5319,4,"Honest Review  I am writing this review after using this laptop for almost 2 months. Overall quality is average unless you have upgraded RAM. I an waiting to purchase an 8GB RAM because RAM consumption is too much by the Windows App, 600MB is reserved by hardware as well. I haven't used any SSD powered laptop so I can't say buying it will speed up your performance or not but am sure with the RAM.  So when I play game (GTA IV) on this laptop. CPU usage is always around 30%-40% RAM usage is a..."
5320,4,It's really. Value for money. Performance wise it's good. Not to expect quick boot and fast multi tasking. But it's quite ok for daily single task activities. Laptop is not much sturdy. Noisy keyboard and noisy mouse pad. Probe to Scratch. 180 degree display is very supportive and still not giving confident not over usage. Though these are all not in harsh note. It's overall good product in this price point.
5321,4,Got this laptop in 24000 only . Best laptop For personal nd simple work . But If you want to do heavy work then you should buy SSD RAM variant for fast performance. Which having cost of 28000 I think . Overall good laptop Battery backup is 2-2.5 hours if you continuously use it.
5322,5,Overall a good product for this price!! Display is good. Battery backup is around 4 hours. Speaker clarity is awesome.... But not more loud. Performance is better than i3 7th gen processor. Ram upgrade is must for improving the speed of the machine.
5323,3,"good laptop at reasonable prices .charger size is small, but speed is not up to the mark. ok for basic college work"
5324,3,First of all I got this gadget in a very low price which was a cool deal with this specifications. No doubt specs are too good but here are some pros and cons after usage of two weeks approx.  Pros:  Design is really good and keys are smooth  Storage is also good  RAM  Genuine windows 10  Genuine microsoft office  AMD ryzen 3 processor  Light weight  Big display  Sound quality is crisp at a defined point  Battery charging time is almost 3 to 3.5 hours from 0 to 100  AMD enabled radeon graphic...
5325,4,"I'm gong to brief about the Pros and Cons only.  Pros - 1. Ryzen 3 Processor 2. AMD Vega 3 Graphics 3. FHD Screen 4. Light weight 5. Windows 10 and MsOffice pre installed 6. Looks  Cons - 1. Battery backup 2. TouchPad 3. Webcam  Now on a simple note for day to day office work or students assignments, surfing its a great deal. If you are thinking of gaming then don't go for it. Else product is good."
5326,3,first of all battery backup is not good design is good webcam is totally poor quality low grade plastic is used so build quality is zero performance is also not so good it takes approx 40_50 seconds to boot after installing all the drivers instead go for acer aspire ryzen 3 with better build quality and performance
5327,5,"A good laptop in the price segment . Dont exoect it to run heavy gaming or work, it's good to go for moderate users like bwosing studying and work."
5328,4,Got this 1 in offer by flipkart big billion days for just 2500....many suggestions i received in terms of low budget laptop..but i wanted to try this product...but this has led me so far aftr months of usage..it comes with great display atleast compared to other brands in this range...but rest all depends upon the user how he manages his pc. but to me its little slow in terms of opening an application but its fine manageable...overall its the most decent 1 i came accrossin this price range.
5329,3,"This one is good if you are looking for general usage. Ram need to be extended for better performance. Camera should be enhanced more , currently it is poor. Other than this is ok for a student."
5330,3,Lenovo is preloaded with default apps which makes the performance slow. Better to disable all those apps not to run on the start up to improve performance. Even I was literally feeling like returning but being an engineer thought give few more days.. suggest Lenovo team also to reduce the preloaded apps or send the technician who comes and does the first time installation and set up. This might be useful for common man  Lookwise it is awesome 500+ mb is dedicated to for display So we get 3.5 ...
5331,4,"Perfect home laptop. Good graphics. And appealing outlook. 15.1inch. and compact and wonderfull. It doesn't have the CD slot. The only disadvantage I found.  Apart from that's this is good with, teams, photoshop, Adobe premiere etc. Its awesome for those type of softwares. And its like good enaf."
5332,3,Worked fine till 6-7 months after that started lagging. Very slow performance. Battery backup is just 2 hours. Low end pc. Motherboard got damaged in just 11 months. The new motherboard replaced by lenovo is not working properly. I think it's not good for heavy usage. The laptop is not as good as expected.
5333,4,"Got it for 24k, good for the mentioned price, don't go for it above 25k, good thing is it can be extended ram and SSD, display is decent and viewing angle is not upto the mark."
5334,3,"Well, using it for several days and it never disappointed me so far. I was a little bit confused about AMD but then found Ryzen 3 3200U is actually better than Intel's i3 8th gen and it can compete even 10th gen in terms of clock speed.  Looks like one must update RAM since it's 4gb isn't enough for multitasking cause it's Slow and Sometimes hangs. And for further betterment one can go for SSDs(NVMe only otherwise replace the HDD)  Display is quite decent in comparison (in that price segment)..."
5335,4,Pro Decent product and built quality compared to price of laptop. Two side bezel definitely look good. R3 is great for light work ideal for office work which doesn't involve heavy software. Most importantly it is cheaper than I3. Keypad is great and button quality and finish is goods Preinstalled Windows and MS office greatly reduce your installation hassle and makes it perfect for non-tech users.  Cons It made in China. Though it has a Graphic card it is not a gaming laptop. Screen is brigh...
5336,5,Awsome laptop in affordable range! Must good going laptop for students and basic uses! Package is nicely.. full care has been taken.. Overall its worth it!
5337,4,"This is a must buy laptop if you wish to get a laptop in 30k as it includes graphics too If you wish to get a laptop for normal use it is the best laptop don't go for a second think to buy this , the display and the features are ausumn  One thing you need to keep in mind is the battery it last for 2, 3 hours on heavy usage. It sometimes hangs but after updates the laptop is working fine (it's an honest review)   I am Giving the review after using the laptop for a month"
5338,4,Laptop is Best in 27K but 4Gb Ram is not Sufficient if you are a casual user then buy it other Wise its waste of money not recommended for Gaming or Editing
5339,5,It's awesome laptop doing great work when u creat account first time it's take time after that it's works excellent and battery is average and I get in 25k on big billion days and it's work smoothly
5340,5,"Excellent product. Early delivery by Flipkart. Good packing. No issue in operation of machine. No issue in activating preinstalled Windows 10 and MS Office 2019. Mcphy antivirus was preinstalled aswell. Overall a good purchase in INR 24490 including one year warranty. Those who are planning to buy core i3 9th generation may consider it as it's performance is no lesser than i3 8th generation and in most of the aspects of performance and several games, it leads i3 9th generation.

5341,4,"This laptop is good for a student like working in ms excel,word,powerpoint and editing and checking email.this laptop only comes in 4gb ram whch is soldered to the motherboard so u can grab another 8gb of ram from flipkart so u can make it much more powerful but not good as expected."
5342,4,I bought this laptop in big billion day sale. It has only 4gb ram. Better to upgrade extra 4gb. After adding extra ram it's work like charm. Battery backup is not that much good. But at this price what you expect. Sound quality is very low after enabling Dolby audio. If your budget is between 25k to 34k definitely buy this one . MS OFFICE is with life time validity. And McAfee Antivirus with 1 month of trial version
5343,5,Laptop is very good performance is very good and battery performance is also nice and charging is 65 word which charge the laptop at very low time performance is super at this the price point
5344,5,I got this laptop in 23k in bbd sale . Design wise this is beautiful laptop but handle with extra care Display of this laptop is not bad it is full hd and too bright but viewing angle make me unhappy other wise gud display. Performance of this is gud for beginners but for multitasking i have addes 8 gb 2400mhz ddr4 ram in extra slot now multitasking is very smooth . Battery is weak point in this laptop it last in 2 to 3 hrs max.but if u have very tight budget go for it in place of second ha...
5345,4,This review is based on few hrs use without any more aap download pre installed windows 10 and ms office this is great but I check battery very keenly because battery is main component of laptop. Use only screen with internet for video backup is 3:30hrs . Use any task with involved processor power . Backup time is 1:45Hrs which is not gud but in this Corona time all laptops and mobile are very high in price no laptops offer this type of specification in this price range design is ok not ...
5346,5,I purchased it for my younger one. Performance is pretty good and I like the way it is slim and handy at this price range.  Recommended product.!
5347,3,"The feel and design is pretty sleek and its genuinely light weighted. Battery performance is average but its good for office work &/or for Work from Home purpose. Biggest down side is that the speakers in this laptop is very low. Ryzen 3 vs Intel 3 was a challenge but if you are saving 2-3K with Ryzen, go for it. Overall satisfied with the product."
5348,5,Go for it...üî•

5361,4,beyond the level of what is expected. though I bought it for 22990/- with an AMD Ryzen processor it works amazingly. worth for money. no need to spend too much of money unwantedly for Intel Processors.

5393,4,Best one to this price (23k) the main dispointment was ram its only 4gb. Due to this less ram performance get little bit lower
5394,1,The battery even after charging 100% does not stay for even for 35mins.
5395,5,"Worthy purchase even in 28k. All-rounder performance. Added extra 4GB DDR4 2400 RAM + NVMe m2 128 GB SSD. Now it loads four times faster than out of the box speed. Recommends for students , programmers and media streamers. Yet it plays most of the games having mid range graphics, not recommends for gaming or studio editing purposes."
5396,3,The laptop if using for multitasking without gaming then it needs to upgraded with SSD/RAM.  Else it will take few minutes to open applications and multitasking is very difficult especially if you are online and presenting.
5397,1,Don't Buy.. Very Slow..
5398,2,Battery is poor..2hrs maximum..hangs sometimes.. Not recommended. Windows 10 and Ms Office is there. The Design of the lap is good.

5402,5,It is to good product but one problem is there its battery backap is poor
5403,3,Average laptop. Don't expect it to be decent quick. Opens up applications after more than 30 secs. Would not recommend it for heavy or moderate use.
5404,5,Best in the segment....strong build quality even it is plastic made.....4 gb ram a bit sluggish because amd processor is damn good for it to use resources...install additional ram will boost it ....go for it..if u want premium looks and best performance üòçüòç

I hardly had any expectation with this laptop, still I am utterly disappointed.

5433,5,Worth for price !
5434,4,Writing this review after 1.5 month of usage. Built quality- 10/10 (looks premium) Camera-2/10 (bad quality) Battery-6/10 (lasts approximately 3 hours) Speed-5/10 (slow speed because of hdd) Display-9/10 (display angles are quite good) Sound-7/10 (not so loud) If you are on a low budget then you should definitely buy it. You should upgrade it to ssd and can also upgrade its ram upto 12 gb whenever you have enough money.
5435,2,Everything is good.. except its hanging problem... It hangs a lot... Sometimes its very irritating while working on it... I don't know what's wrong....
5436,5,Good
5437,5,If you have budget of 30k then go for it.
5438,5,Nice product
5439,3,It's an average product.. In this price range I would also suggest to see other alternatives.. Battery backup is less Display is good It lags in between We have to increase the RAM for better performance No slot for LAN cable No USB slot in right of the laptop.. slots are in left side Cursor button pad is bit stiff.

5502,5,"4gb ram 1TB HDD AMD Ryzen 3 (which is equal to i3 7th gen) Windows 10 pre installed MS office preinstalled for life time MeAfee anti virus for 1yr 15.6 inches FHD display Dolby sound Overall pretty good under 30k  But, the main worst part is cooling fan sound is too disgusting"
5503,2,Device speed is very slow not up to level doesn't worth for price
5504,1,Battery power is low...fan sound is high... don't buy this product
5505,3,It hangs a most while..better to get upgraded ram to 8 g or 12 gb then there could be some hike in performance..
5506,5,Much more better than Intel i3 processor Best budget laptop .......
5507,4,"Everything's are good, only the length of the charger is very short."
5508,3,I hate it. Its performance is very slow. It takes too much time open Ms excel. Now think about about the other applications. Think before you purchase this laptop.
5509,2,PC is very slow. Brought based on review from you tube. All are fake a good laptop will cost more. I can't even use smoothy for Normal office work. Any applications take at least 10-15 seconds for opening.

5514,3,Laptop is slow but if you are going for this consider upgrading RAM to 8 or 12 gb else go for 4gb 256 ssd or 8gb 1tb hdd. After upgrade it works like a charm.

5552,5,Genuine product and worth to buy it
5553,5,The best laptop

5555,3,Go to more ram 4 gb ram is not much better..go to more ram such as 8 gb or 12 gb ram...I upgraded to 12 gb..... now performance is better........
5556,1,Sometime os not working properly slow performance
5557,5,It's good product for daily use.
5558,4,Value product but you need to install ssd for better performance
5559,3,"After lot of research, I have bought it but the performance is not good, and it takes time to start up. Even sometimes when open a new tab its keep rolling up. The design looks fine."
5560,1,"Just 4 hours of use and the display is so poor I can watch a movie on my phone instead, the sound is so low can't even hear clear with the laptop on my lap"
5561,5,Superb
5562,3,Very slow performance
5563,4,Very good in this budget.
5564,1,Dont buy this laptop
5565,4,Battery drain in about 3 to 4 hours other wise everything is ok
5566,1,Not so good it started hanging after only 10-12 days of usage.
5567,2,It is started hanging problem from very second use of it
5568,4,"Everything is good till now Battery could be better And The max briteness is not up to the need , it feels low when sunlight comes, could be 2 or 3 point more Else good One more complain why the hell price suddenly decreases from 30990 to 28990 after placing the order, it's unfair"
5569,2,Very Bed experience with processing and battery capacity.
5570,5,Good
5571,3,"You should add 8gb ram,or else its waste,it not 8gb ram i will compare it to pentium processor"
5572,3,"Very slow device. Even if you want to use it for educational purposes, jts not useful as it runs very slow. Now i need to spend extra to upgrade it with SSD memory or RAM"
5573,2,"Not satisfied,,,"
5574,1,Hanging problem
5575,3,Better to buy laptop with 8 gb ram. Display is good. Performance slow with 4 gb ram.
5576,1,"Lot of noise was coming from fan+cpu assembly of laptop. So I have returned it. Also had issues with battery, only 2.5 hrs time with battery. Heating issues were also there."
5577,4,Very slow
5578,1,Veru slow laptop dont buy it !!!!!
5579,3,Very slow
5580,3,Cheap and best. Home and Student purpose ok.
5581,4,It does its job and is a good budget laptop but do keep in mind that it is not meant for gaming and adding extra 8gb RAM (as i did) gives much more stable perfomance.... I got it for 25k for that price its absolutely great!
5582,3,It's getting fan sound heavy
5583,5,Nice product
5584,1,Worst performance
5585,4,Good.......
5586,4,Only problem is battery drain fastly. Otherwise best product. Worth buying at this price
5587,3,"This is a entry level budget laptop and even has a good performance due to the AMD processor, gaming might be twitchy while playing mediocre game but handles every day daily task easily but might be a bit slow while multitasking, overall it is not 5 star but a manageable lap for students and entry level laptop learners I would say"
5588,4,Display and built quality could have been better ... over All ok for that price ...
5589,5,It is good for free fire üî•üî•üî•
5590,1,Poor defect product

5592,5,Nice laptop took for my brother.
5593,2,Perfomance is so bad. I can't even use the mouse properly. Only the design is good
5594,3,Starting it was okay but as days passed its geeting slow. After opening application its doing good. But it lags while opening the application
5595,4,Good laptop for mid range users not good for gaming. But no lag.
5596,3,It is a 'kaam chalau' laptop. Bought it for my Dad. The only thing he doesn't like about it is its trackpad which feels weird and too plasticy so we use a external mouse.
5597,3,Battery down fast..And you can't see the screen cross directions...Only straight you can watch on this.. As per this drawbacks price is very high.dont buy.
5598,5,Using from 2 months no issue occurred till now. Processor are good for this price. If you want to use for your online classes then go for it
5599,1,Worst product.. Huge fan sound within one month. No proper support from flipkart.
5600,3,Dear team no body help me for system installation please help me
5601,5,"Very good Product and features also stylish design, Full HD display etc."

5604,1,Very slow and the keyboard is bad and fan sound coming inside overall very bad product Totally irritated by buying this product
5605,4,Awesome project

5608,5,Best product
5609,3,Battery is Just about of 1.7 hours something . Just Useless Battery ...The upper case that is the Monitor Panel is too light that....It moves like ...There is wind blowing....Very Light ...But Overall to use this...U just need to Attach Power Cable everytime...
5610,2,Worst product
5611,1,Very slow and sluggish. Intel laptops are based. Finally sold it out
5612,4,display:4/5 battery:3/5 keyboard:4.5/5 performance:4/5
5613,1,"Battery problem, low speed ,don‚Äôt waste a money"
5614,5,One of the the best product on this price range
5615,4,"It's a Budget Laptop, never expect a Gr8 performance. But a very Student required Performance"
5616,1,Waste of Money
5617,5,THE LAPTOP IS VERY GOOD AND YOU BELIEVE ME BUYER'S IF YOU ARE DECIDING TO BUY A LAPTOP WITHIN A RANGE OF 30K TO 32K YOU CAN EASILY AND WITHOUT THINKING TWICE GO FOR IT.. IT IS VERY BETTER THAN i3 8th generation THANK YOU!!
5618,4,Slow but it's ok.

5620,3,Sound quality is poor..Battery backup is average..Anti virus free for one month only..

5622,1,Too much lag I can't use it daily basis waste of money I lost my money but I wanted to save your money so if your bray is in right place so don't buy it
5623,5,"1. Worth the money i spend. I have got in 24 k in big billion sale. 2. Plays 4K video flawlessly. You can imagine the processing power it has. 3. Designed beautifully, looks like it's made of metal body. 4. Adapter wire is short 5. Screen is bright enough and sharp due to 1080p resolution 6. Boot time 20 second, shutdown time 5 second. 7. Battery backup is 3 hrs with movie playing with highest brightness and full volume."
5624,2,"Very bad machine 25k ,,very hangedd +takingvtime to much ,"
5625,4,Not bad
5626,5,Price to Performance ratio is very good. Works like a charm for standard multitasking. Design is a big plus. Looks very elegant and classy. Weight balancing is also pretty good. Battery life is average 4-5 hours. Would suggest everyone to increase the ram to atleast 8GB. Better than Intel i3 7th gen that you might get in this price bracket. A great buy. Satisfied with the product.
5627,5,good one
5628,3,Fast delivery just in 31 days..... Nice product worth @. 25 k
5629,2,"Service post delivery after raising complaints was bad. Multiple follow ups and end result was nothing. Things take time to load even with a blank laptop. Screen part of the laptop has no stability, shakes a lot. You need to press hard on the mouse pad not the smoothest. If bought will need to be upgraded with better RAM."
5630,5,Superb product lenovo
5631,5,This laptop is not for heavy work.
5632,4,Battery backup is only 4 hours

5638,4,Good for office and study use.
5639,4,Laptop is good for daily use..not for gaming...but battery backup is low
5640,2,Bettery is not better
5641,1,"Laptop is dead slow I never expected ghis from Lenovo especially, why did they released such an laptop. If we want to upgrade the memory also no info provided in bios regards to speed in MHz.  To those people who want to purchase this one kindly look for Other laptops."
5642,4,Ita worth it !!! According to the price range.
5643,5,Very handy and good looking nice performance
5644,2,"Very slow processing ,was not expecting from Lenovo."

5647,5,It's amazing product
5648,3,"Not so great overall but decent for the price i got.  Preformance is just ok you need need atlest 8gb ram and ssd for better performance.  Battery life is mediocre.  Display is full HD although not so bright and viewing angle is poor.  Few keyboard in button didn't work at start got some solution online, but ut keep happening after windows update."
5649,5,I am satisfied with this product and price
5650,5,"A really good product considering that it's so affordable, I recommend it to anyone who needs it for basic tasks like surfing, typing, school and office work in general. However, I would recommend that you upgrade the RAM a 4GB upgrade would be ok, but I recommend adding another 8GB as a lot of it is taken by background processes (I was even able to play GTA V with the 8GB upgrade) The only little problem I have aside that is the display is a little off coloured."
5651,4,All goods but battery is medium
5652,5,value for money
5653,5,Excellent laptop performance is goodüëçüëçüëç
5654,5,Awesome product thanks to flipkart

5656,1,"Very bad laptop, very slow, hanging problem due to dicount offer i got in low budjet but go for i3"
5657,2,I thought it's good laptop but after one day it became very slow I think I need to add more ram and SSD to it in order to use it.
5658,5,Just expect to update the ram to atleast another 4 gb.. Laptop isn't so slow as its own.. But when there's a heavy load it will lag.. You can make this a beast if you can upgrage the ram and ssd.
5659,2,Laptop accha hai but battery is not good
5660,5,It is very useful and the best laptop ever.
5661,3,Not having CD disc drive. I am surprised that laptop is not having disc drive. Hanged once with in week
5662,5,All is well
5663,2,"Laptop is light weight and stylish in design. As per product description on detail page, it comes with lifetime MS office and free one year subscription of McAfee, but in reality the MS office applications are not getting updated and applications are not working as well as the subscription is only a 20 days trial and you have to purchase separate paid subscription of McAfee. Well the delivery system of the product is horrible and got my laptop after whopping 10 days....."
5664,5,Laptop is working fine no issues of heating or hanging while working face by me. Battery backup is good and it can work upto three hours without charge. Overall fine performance.
5665,4,Average

5672,4,Good product
5673,4,Product is good.. but a very delayed service from Flipkart.. would never trust on Flipkart again for any items as commitment to customer is on least priority for them.
5674,1,"Cost to feature good deal, but quite sometime lags in performance. So overall disappointed. The windows update even can't go smoothly installed on the laptop. very pathetic / poor performance."
5675,4,Nice
5676,3,One thing is annoying in this laptop is its fan noise.
5677,4,Overall good machine for basic work.  Using aroun 8-9 hours a days.  Battery -3-4 hrs average  Display 4/5  Performance 4/5
5678,5,Amazing product at this priceüòçüòç
5679,5,Dont hesitate before buying it.. True reviews- Battery backup is low If you want to use it heavy upgrade the ram and ssd The 4gb 1 tb varient is pathetic.. But if you upgrade it you will love the performance
5680,3,its overall performance of battery is very low with in one hr the 100% battery draining out very bad performance
5681,5,"Overall product is good. Good Picture quality, Good battery and good performance by processor. But build up quality is not so strong, quality of keypad is not so good, it should be improved. Flipkart customer support is very bad, they only provide assurance, not resolution. I does not get McAfee antivirus 12 month subscription. Today 15 days are going to end of delivery but still not getting Antivirus license key."
5682,5,"Value for money, I upgraded ram to 12 and its performance changed a lot, now i can play games like gta5"

5693,1,This laptop gets heated and making too loud noise.
5694,5,Nice... For student.... At low budget... I purchased in big billion days at 25240
5695,1,Microphone not working...touchpad is loosely fitted...poor build quality...delay flipkart delivery...never buy anything from lenovo...build poorly and in huge amount so the price is so less but it will hardly last for 2 years...batter to go for Asus Vivobook 15 or any higher brands like Dell or hp...if you compromise with quality...you will regret later...spend some more money and go for other brands if you dont want your laptop last for only 1 or 2 years...
5696,3,"Non of the windows drives were up to date, had to upgrade everything and until it was upgarded, MS office wont get installed.  Lags a lot, better to get the RAM upgraded. Not for gamers or heavy users"
5697,5,Excellent product... Flipkart please make sure that the item is delivered on the committed time...
5698,4,"One of the best laptops in the market at 26k ,I think I can't get better deal at this price. But the performance of the laptop is average what we can expect in this prise range Other wise it is a complete killer"
5699,5,If you get a DDR4 2400mhz ram it will run fast as lightning and because of dual channel and 2 gb vram it runs games like GTA5 and almost all Big titles in gaming with descent fps on low settings .Check its benchmarks on youtube it runs almost all games descently.
5700,2,Very very very slow.
5701,5,Fully value for money purchase.
5702,5,Good deal
5703,5,"I got this laptop at 24240 Rs during sale time.  Design is very nice. Very slim and delicate. Display is full HD with matt finishing, but viewing angle is very poor because of TN display. I personally suggest for 14 inch display. Because in case of 15.6 inch display, screen is lightly swing/tilting with ceiling fan air. Performance is average, it justify price. Not so great. Battery backup is average, depend on usage, with internet it consume more power. Average 4 hour battery backup. But co..."

5711,3,"Battery life less than 3 hours. Display isnt upto the mark. Lenevo 30gb promotion with Dropbox offer doesnt work. Better to upgrade RAM as onboard 4 gb will not help in even basic tasks, will always lag. Not for heavy use. Ok for basic programming and studies."

5734,4,"Got it for 26 k on sale,best laptop for that price with a powerful Ryzen 3 processor"
5735,3,"The performance of this laptop SUCKS, really , truly sucks.  Dont buy this laptop for any more than 25k, so you can afford a ram upgrade & probably a ssd.  The display is above average. The battery is poor. The look is great.  Performance is worse than a pentium laptop."
5736,4,In ad it was written that Microsoft Office app is preloaded whereas I find that only Microsoft 365 is loaded for one year only. Rest all is fine so far.
5737,2,Slow Laptop

5747,2,Bat
5748,4,Just bought this laptop.fully satisfied.worth every single penny.only one flaw is battery backup that is quite small.but charging is fast so no concerns. Do not purchase if you are a heavy gamer or want to do too many tasks.overall this laptop is good for students and professionals.go for it if your budget is around 25k to 27k
5749,4,"At this price point this one is very good The problem i faced is about speakers,the sound quality is very poor.better to but a sound bar or any small rated speakers"
5750,3,Good
5751,4,Great laptop for beginners. Might operate slowly due to low ram capacity. Windows 10 is also great
5752,3,"ok not so fast , speaker volume is less i dont where dolby digital has been used , no keyboard light display .very slow opening .opening three apps systems gets stuck."
5753,5,It's good... battery upto 5 hours....design super
5754,4,Everything is good except battery backup... hardly 3 to 4hrs while browsing and 2hrs when zoom call is on. Good thing is it was getting changed with in 1hr 30mins
5755,4,It is best laptop under 40000. If your budget is higher than 40000 then go for other laptops Everything is fine but yellowish didplay
5756,4,"For the price it's an amazing product. A little sluggish at times, perfect for casual usage."
5757,4,Nyc
5758,5,Awesome laptop..
5759,4,"This laptop is pretty good for the price tag it comes with. Got it for 23k in the big billion day sale. the only drawback was the 4 gb ram...these days even phones dont work well with 4 gb ram. i would suggest anyone buying this should also get additional 8 gb ram along with it to make this laptop amazing. The highlight is the design, thin bezels and display..i dont think any other company is giving these specifications in this price range. i am Pretty happy with the purchase as i bought adat..."
5760,5,I have bought it at 25k at that price it is best. Battery life i average when connected to WiFi. And sometimes it lags also.
5761,1,"Error status is shown as ""Hard Disk"" not installed. Disappointed with purchase"
5762,3,Built quality is poor
5763,4,"The RAM should be upgraded else the performance is very slow, after the upgrade it is good"
5764,5,Very good laptop of this price.
5765,4,"Laptop is awesome .. Best laptop under 30k Better go with Amd ryzen 3 instead if Intel core i3 8th gen, Laptop delivered after 8 days of book date ,it's OK bcoz purchased on big billions days , happy with this laptop"
5766,4,Wonderful laptop
5767,3,"Camera is ridiculously bad ..no clarity ..want to understand whether it's the issue with the laptop recieved or its universal with this model ... Keyboard acts funny ..they are actually interchanged so if u want @ u need to press shift and "" to get it instead of shift and 2. ..."
5768,4,"The laptop looked great however the build quality could have been better (plastic body). Got MSO student version with it and one month trial Anti virus. Battery is good but that depends how Im using my laptop. AMD ryzen is a powerful range of processors, let's see how it holds up in future. Digital Dolby sounds great. Fast charging almost takes 90min to full charge from 5%. Decent webcam. Keyboard looks great but without backlit so in dark look hard. But the design looks sweet and slim."
5769,2,After using it for a month now I can say it's too slow even in day to day tasks. I don't know with 4 gb of ram and 1 tb of hard disk how a laptop can work too slow. I also think AMD Ryzen 3 processor performance is not up to the mark it's too slow u must go with intel processors.
5770,5,"Superbb product ,ryzen 3 is better than i3"
5771,3,not bad at this price

5790,3,"performance average lit bit slow , display colors not natural and camera is very poor"
5791,5,I think it is best laptop for students.you will get 4 gb ram but you have to upgrade ram to 8 gb for better performance.Otherwise you will get poor performance.battery is about 3-3.5 hours.Display is very good.
5792,5,Very very very super laptop all is good.
5793,4,If u want it for daily purpose...it's the best in the Range. And if u want to do some heavy work..I would recommend upgrade the Ram to 8Gb

5804,4,"Hi,  It's been 4 months since I started using this laptop. I would like to say that it is a good beginners' device for basic functionality; no heating/hanging issues, tactile & responsive keyboard, good color saturation on the screen, charges fast and has moderate weight.  Overall, a good buy for the price."
5805,3,"Good design and light weight but performance is average because it's a budget laptop under 25k. Only for student or normal working or entertainment use, not suggest for multitasking or heavy use."
5806,4,Very nice product i love it .
5807,5,That's nice but performance will be batter after ram upgradation
5808,5,The display and build quality is damn good.Feels premium. Battery life is medium. 4.5 hours-5 hours on full charge. Processor speed is good enough. Ryzen 3 is better than i3 in terms of speed. Front camera is the only down side here.. its below average Overall it is awesome and probably best in the price range.. Theres a brand called Avita which offers higher specs like Ryzen 5 and 8gb ram in similiar price range but again its risky as its not a renowned brand and after sales service can be h...
5809,4,GOOD FOR STUDENTS AND OFFICE WORK
5810,3,"Build quality is good. Sound is very bad, lenevo should improve this. Display is ok. Battery backup is bad."

5817,3,"With 4 gb memory, we are not supposed to work on windows 10... too slow..."
5818,5,Good
5819,5,A nice handy product from Lenovo. Ryzen 3 is performing outstandingly. Sound quality is top class. Overall a fine product.
5820,4,Nice laptop with awesome build quality in this price point. Best buy if you are going to do just browsing and simple tasks on laptop.. Best value for money.
5821,2,Laptop get hanged in normal uses. Keep hanging at start and need reset of pc again and again

5826,1,System is very slow. It will take atleast 15 minutes to open. After that if you try to open a word document again it will take 30 mnts. Please don't go for this.

5830,3,Average Performance
5831,5,Nice Product
5832,1,Very pathetic performance.it gets hanged even if you is being played.not for multitasking. HD video is also seems as a normal standard video
5833,2,"Poor performance, battery backup is too low"
5834,4,Good budget laptop. I was sluggish initially... But was good after few configuration setting changes. The viewing angle of the display isn't good. It can be used for basic office work and online learning
5835,4,"This is the best laptop you can get at this price range, works well for all basic usage, softwares like Photoshop, Movavi Video Editor, etc. also works very smooth üòä"
5836,5,Nice productüòä
5837,5,I am using this laptop from 3 months... This is the best laptop in this price range... Best for your office work...No lagging (disable start up of affecting apps) For students it is perfect to learn and attend online classes... No buffering while playing Asphalt 8...  Just Go For It...
5838,4,Product is good but due some network settings fan started running continuously for 3 days then i went to reset network settings then it has been stopped.....

5846,2,"The Laptop was working fine eventually however later the battery life decrease drastically & the processor slowed down, now it feels like I clicked on n icon q century back & it just loaded the page."
5847,1,Don't even think of buying this if u do that u gonna waste Ur money... It take almost 10-15 minutes even to copy and paste a 30-40 mb file and u know what is even more frustrating that u even can't do anything else while it is copying bcoz it will hang if u try to do so.... Very slow laptop ...my old laptop that I got from gov. For free was better than this....won't buy it even if someone is selling it for 5000 only
5848,3,Good
5849,1,Its the worst laptop. Don't think I am a lenovo hater . Its problems 1. Battery backup is only 1 hour after fully charged 2. Don't even think of buying it for gaming . FPS is low and the laptop hangs . Even with 1gb graphic card and 4 gb ram it sucks
5850,5,Must buy. Excellent and is all rounder
5851,5,Most perfect
5852,4,Pros: ryzen3 is good @this price range : Good display : Premium looking design Cons: build quality is not that good : Touch pad is not so responsive : Hdd

5856,3,Product very good but just sometime.lag this device.
5857,2,"I am writing this review after using this product more than a month. Processor is very slow, it's even hangs up if we work on more than 3 windows at the same time. To me I doubt that the company is actually installed RYZEN 3 processor, since it's seems to be working on some really old processor. Battery backup is also not very impressive all together is not the value for money at all."
5858,2,"Hangs alot. Performance is also very slow. It was having 10days replacement, but these 10days almost take for product installation and after thay when we start to qork gradually things comes up which become hell to even qork"
5859,3,Battery backup is not good
5860,1,"It has not even been a year, and the laptop is terribly slow, mouse has stopped working and one key kept auto typing until I disabled it with external software. I called the customer care, five days back, they haven't sent the engineer yet. My experience is not good with this device since beginning. I Do not recommend this laptop."
5861,1,Takes more than 10 minutes some times to open 1 excel file. Very slow processing
5862,2,Slow. Poor battery
5863,1,Worst things ever purchase Mother board note work after 1 month..
5864,3,Over all good product

5867,1,Very worst product Dont buy Fan sound is very high and both customer care are not responding
5868,1,Keyboard is not working after the use of 2 months...Also The Mouse Pad Is Not Working.... Attempted For Warray
5869,3,after using it for 2 months its pretty slow and worst sound quality
5870,1,"Please, fraud, defective Product, small size not order this product"
5871,2,Low audio and performance

5873,4,very good product for student
5874,3,"OCT 2020- System crashed, got it fixed since under warranty. it was motherboard issue and they had to replace it. Now seriously doubt about the RYZEN processors. god knows how i am going to manage after warranty period.  September 2020 Slow system, bought for daughter online classes. Using for around 2 months now. Sometimes it freezes while in online classes."
5875,3,The Camera quality is too bad & the sound of the speaker is too low to listen. Didn't expect this type of quality from LENOVO. Do anyone has the way how to over this issue?  Picture quality is good.
5876,3,Very slow. We Need to upgrade Ram for better performance.
5877,4,If u use a wireless mouse and dont care much about battery life ... it is pretty decent notebook for the price. Suits my need absolutely fine. Have upgraded ram and installed SSD and its pretty quick.
5878,5,"This Laptop has been great so far. I got this for the MS Office offer and Windows that were free. I got this Laptop only for office use. Surprisingly, it runs games from 2012 quite well. Games like Assassin's Creed Black Flag and Batman: Arkham City run well on low settings. This is when I have not even upgraded my ram to 8gb dual channel which was recommended by many tech articles. I will get it later. Remains cool and does not heat up that much. Battery is not that good, but you can use th..."

5885,4,Just ok
5886,4,Value for money laptop
5887,3,"Customer support very poor... If someone willing to buy, then put the money in some other use or buy it form nearly shop.. but do not take such product from flipkart.. My money totally lost.. And also lenovo support very poor and disappointing.."
5888,1,The brand new laptop is terribly slow.. there is lag for everything and I wish I can return the product.. not worth it
5889,3,"Ordered it and received ontime. Firstly very bad camera, those who use for online meeting, full grains u can see. Battery drains fast 2hrs max u can use. First 10 days return period it was silent but after that fan started making noise too much don't know any solution to it. Overall average to little above average performance for this price range."
5890,4,good laptop but battery drains faster not satisfied with battery backup it has overall performance is good except the battery backup.
5891,5,I loved it ? WFH People's Just go for it.‚ù§

5893,2,My laptop speaker sound is turn so low. Dnt buy it.
5894,4,I feel little bit slow as hear about other person. Otherwise it is good for office work. Battery is also average not much atleast 2-3 hours giving backup. I will suggest all of u if u want to work day to day lifestyle just go for this laptop.. remember it carefully this laptop coming with plastic body..so plz use protection
5895,3,Sound speaker very worst pls design speaker in top of the laptop dont put sound speaker on down audio level very very low
5896,4,Good one
5897,5,Nice product according to budget
5898,3,Fan makes continuous noise which is irritating. Rest is just like any other laptop in this price range.
5899,4,Super
5900,3,I just think it's an average performing laptop. Maybe that's what you get for this price . ONE TIP use it on the LAP or a STAND if keep it on bed and use it for long it will over heat and start crashing until gets cool
5901,4,Fab oneüî•üî• but battery backup not so good except everything is litüî•üî•

5910,1,"Writing review after 2 week's usage, cheap plastic used for the surface, makes it look like cheap stock. Completely freezes when used with multiple chrome windows, only 1 window of chrome is allowed at a time, its has 4GB DDR4 of RAM but dont know why its not hyper-vising. A simple task of click on the start menu takes 3secs to launch."
5911,4,Good in performance...also under budget..
5912,5,Best Laptop in this Price.
5913,4,"You can get any laptop within any price and if you count on best product within a defined range and especially for students , mid professional with less requirements, lenovo S145 is ideal.  Best for students, accountants. Go ahead with this price range best quality laptop"
5914,4,"Everything is good, the battery backup is 3 to 4 hrs. Could have been better."
5915,1,Very poor performance and dead slow
5916,3,Good but not the best
5917,5,Not a good battery attachment its daraining fast. On base of desing and display its a option for this budget. Overall performance can be more better i think for its not a good option for netflicks. I feel some lag when browsing and it is slow Some times
5918,3,Battery life is pathetic ... Hardly lasts for 2 hours.

6035,5,nice
6036,5,Nice phone. Worth a money. At this price point what else can you ask for? .. Thanks Redmi.. I found some interesting features in the camera. Nice Disply and it's fast indeed. Battery life is pretty good. Overall it's decent smarty..
6037,4,Quality wise good. Good performance of the prize. Cam quality was good what ever it as simply awsome.. üòáüòò
6038,4,As usual value for money device.. one thing that attracts me the most is Stereo speakers.. Awesome sound quality.. FHD+ Display is so nice and 6000mH battery as well.. Decent product from Redmi. Go for it Camera quality also decent üôÇ
6039,5,I liked this phone as much as I can praise it. and tha phone is very very good colour thanks you very much Flipkart üíùüôÉüòò
6040,4,I am using this phone for three days. Speed is good üëçüëç display is cool with a waterdrop notch. Good backup battery. For a budget phone i hada great experience.
6041,5,Nice phone iba very happy camer is good I like it Redmi 9 power
6042,4,"Very Good Product. Everything is Good. Best part is battery which is long durable. It could be much better if having- Camera: Some features more Zoom features, require high megapixel for front camera. Procesor: Slightly lower  But interm of value for money, it is very Good Product."
6043,4,Overall good but if you are a camera lover than this is not good for you Battery is like 4000 mh And yes heating issue when you use afternoon time and also while charging it's heating I will give 7 out of 10
6044,4,After MIUI V12.0.7.0 update performance is good but camera is very worse in low light only because it's software is not well optimising after clicking image. During clicking photo looks good but after save it just worsen quality. Avoid for camera use as you get good photos only in very good lighting like in morning & afternoon.
6045,5,"Set is superb and the person who delivered it to me is very nice and trying to make customer valuable by his work ,he delivered it to me on time.thank you üòä"
6046,5,"I have ordered this for my friend and used couple of days. My opinion  FLIPKART DELIVERY WAS A DAY EARLY.  BATTERY : Was good long lasting Video's, online games didn't made much dent battery ..  Display : display looks clear & very good  Camera : Camera is very good in sunlight & 48 mp camera shot was beautiful.. but night mode not so amazing  Value for money : Yes it is 100% value for money..   Ps : i would have opted for redmi note 10"
6047,5,It's a good phone at the price point but you will be slightly disappointed with front camera but considering the price point it's a good deal I am really loving the experience of the performance of the phone even the finger print sensor is also has no great delay and display is excellent Over all it's a good phone at the price
6048,3,"Writing my reviews after 4 days of use. Pros. 1. Side mounted finger senser, it works well. 2. Battery backup is good, easily lasts for a day. 3. Fast charging, works well Cons. 1. Biggest one is camera, its pretty ordinary, I will never believe in their Megapixels value, its not at all 48MP. INFACT, its barely 8MP. AI is also not so good. Front Cam is even worst, Its like a 2MP camera from some branded phone. I dont know why are they putting these many Cameras on the back  I needed a budge..."
6049,5,Awesome mobile redmi 9 power. It's working nicely and battery backup is Very good. Overall it's a very good item. Thanks.
6050,5,"This phone is amazing and I love this phone like this range awesome processors, camera , display and other features. This phone is very good."
6051,4,Good phone camera quality is good and the most important things is battery backup is very good. It will give long last 14 hours to 16 hours on full use of phone
6052,5,I am giving this review after 1 week just to ensure the quality properly. First talk about Flipkart it has given me the decent product no damage no issues. now about the mobile I really like the mobile the performance is very good . No damage everything is fine. Worth purchase. But there is slight heating issue while charging. Other wise it's a decent product.
6053,3,"Its a normal smartphone only. Don't get lured by this 48 MP camera , its of no use and on words only. Its capable of taking a normal pic only which even 5 MP cam takes. Better opt for any other smartphone with 6 GB RAM in same price."
6054,4,Fiery red colour is excellent Battery backup is also very good Camera quality is best Phone was slim and light weight Value for money
6055,5,Thise products is comapaire to valuable product is good and cameras clarity is good you valuable Mony on products performance is batter to new trading need person want on product..
6056,5,The phone has pretty good camera and battery life. Not impressed by the performance though. But as a whole is a good deal as per my choice. Only for thise who need good camera and good battery life. Again has 1080p display which adds a bit of beauty to viewing experience. The speakers are great for the price. Happy with the purchase.
6057,5,"Well, after a month's use, I think you'll have to go for this mobile! Great battery performance, camera is quite amazing, charges quickly, the touch is nice, overall, has a great structure :)) For this price, it is a good choice!"
6058,3,I am completely disappointed after taking this phone. Price is bit high compare to other barand available in the market.. Other budget phone give phone rocrd option but mi didn't give even record option in this phone... Very mu disappointed. And performance wise phone is very laggy . I won't recommend other don't go any mi device better go for samsung or iPhone
6059,5,Good phone good speaker good battery life no hang very good I love it

8886,5,"Received today. Hard to judge a new phone from the perspective of its battery backup capacity. But the camera quality has overwhelmed me. I did not expect such good camera feature and quality at this price range. Just test by enlarging a shot upto even thrice, it's still not broken into pixels. Don't doubt about display quality and other features. It will not disappoint you considering the price. I got it at 8200 approx after exchanging old phone. Thanks flipkart for excellent n unparalleled..."

9363,3,Overall the phone is good I am just writing my review after a week of usage ..  1. Camera is too good in this price segment 2. Display is little bit dull in day time when you go out in sunlight even though the brightness is full nothing is clear on screen. 3. Battery backup is outstanding. 4. Stereo speaker is clear and good.  Disadvantages  Lack of speed for 4 GB ram Mobile is getting warm even for minimal usage.

9692,5,Good Product Good Delivery Timing
9693,3,Loved the Color Good Finish It's bulky as far as size n it's physical feel is concerned. Display is very dull Almost Stock Android makes accesability quite an easy thing Cam is great for this price point Spot Color Pic is a nice add on in camera 128 GB with 6 GB ram would have been an icing on cake Battery drains off ridiculously. Software issue looks like.. else poor optimization.. 90htz refresh is not a gimmick.. it works and helps create a good smooth experience.
9694,4,"Phone is really good in terms of value. With Micromax In1 in market, this one is not ""real"" value for money, I think. Because the display is just 720p... Motorola could have opted 1080p over 90 hertz display. The processor is really good at snappy and does no lag. The camera indoor is pathetic. If we use the pro mode of the camera, we can get a better results even in indoors. Having said that, Camera works good in daylight. I purchased this phone for my father, and my main requirement for me ..."
9695,5,"Overall very nice phone with all the latest feature such as android 11. Three finger screen shot , recorder and etc .battery back up is very good big display compared to other phones .camera is also good. Would recommend to buy this phone because its a budget phone with all feature."
9696,5,Mobile is very good and performance I gifted my sister on her birthday She is very happy thank u moto and also thank u Flipkart
9697,5,"There are options out there that can give you better value for money like Poco, but this is honestly a very good phone as well. If you have price constraints or don't want to shift to other phone brands, this is the Moto phone to get while the prices are still lower. Personally, from a week's usage, I can tell you that it is a great phone from moto. The selling point for gamers would be its 90HZ refresh rate which the G10 doesn't have, & its custom gametime mode that has some functionality. N..."
9698,4,Overall a decent mobile to purchase if you are not a heavy user. Camera does a good job though it gives realistic pictures so don't expect them to be extra punchy and colorful. 90 hz refresh rate makes the use smoother. Battery lasts long enough to not bother you. And moto unique features are like cherry on the top. You can go for it without even thinking twice.
9699,4,Camer performance is ok not that wow and not that bad in this budget range good performance. Battery life is also ok if use in battery saver mode battery will.work better All over good phone in range need to work but on camera and battery
9700,5,Every phone will have same features but I love Motorola because of its gestures ‚ù§Ô∏è. It hasgood battery It has decent camera It has good processing speed and smooth running Only thing is it has plastic body...
9701,3,Pros: 1. Smooth Performance And Long-Lasting Battery. 2. Stock Android Software Experience. 3. High-refresh rate display. 4. Good price for value  Cons: 1. Camera Performance Seems Pretty Average. 2. Full Plastic Body which really feels cheap in hand. 3. No 4K video recording. 4. Max display brightness is pretty weak.
9702,2,Its too big & very heavy too. Have the 1st Generation Moto phone which is still working much better than this phone. that was the perfect size which fits into the pocket very nicely. Battery life is also very bad. As everyone can see the reviews the camera is also bad. the 3 finger touch screenshot capture also doesn't work many a times. sound quality also not very good. Expected a much much better product after reading the specifications. But utterly disappointed with the product. Advice is ...
9703,5,Best Product According to price in every aspect. I have trust on Moto because I was using Moto G5S Plus till now(used for 3+ years). Love the software experience Moto provides. Would love to see more options from Moto in 15-20k and 20-25k.
9704,5,One of my favourite brand... N love to see it's coming up with better features every time ... Specially needed this kind of features in budget oriented phones... Loved it..

9707,4,"Well using the device for the last 3 weeks. Here is the review-  1. Rear Camera is average, auto focus is good. Macro and wide angle has no autofocus, comes with fixed focal length. It takes little time to process the photos in the background (like Gcam) which is very annoying. Front camera is the worst. Low light performance is very poor. Video quality is poor, focusing struggles. Video stabilisation is not available, you have to use Gcam for that. Don't buy if you a selfie maniac or a photo..."

(I upgraded from SD435) The moto glass is lightyears better than a notification light.  Moto's little tweaks are way too awesome."
9713,5,Device looks very promising and the performance is kind of okay. I was hoping with update they might push carrier aggregation (4G+) which really in this device. I like the 90Hz refresh rate and 20w turbocharger.
9714,5,Best phone for normal usersüíØ.  üî¥Note:- This is the review after using it for 1 day.  I have ordered this for my parents and it is best phone for them.  üîä Sound quality(loudness) is average to good. üîã Battery backup is also greatüíØ Easily handle 14 to 20 hrs with continuous usage of data and hotspot. üîå Charging speed is also average to good.

9716,2,Unbiased and genuine opinion. Bought it for my father but disappointed. Lenevo has degraded moto's standard a lot. Camera: Photos have a soft touch with blurred edges. The details doesn't match the standard of a lower budget phone like poco c3 too. Macro camera is useless. Could have used dual camera setup with better hardware atleast.  Display: If you use a full hd display phone as a daily driver you can easily spot the blurred adaptive icons of the app drawer. There is no necessity of a 90h...
9717,4,"It has 64 MP quad camera that's good it depends upon how you click picture,90 HZ frequency which is nice at this price point, 5000 mAh battery that's also nice, display size is also good, screen could have been more clear when you will see it from side picture will look black, if it would have been super amoled it would have been great experience, ram is 4 GB that is good but processors could have been little bit better, it has light sensor which will adjust your phone light according, face s..."

9719,3,"Pros: Best part is the stock android. Performance is good. Camera qualoty os also satisfactory with the price given, doesn't look truly 64MP camera though but with the price of the phone , no complaints.  Cons: Phone batyery is not so good. Charging is slow and power back is not good as well. Pocks up heat sometimes. Its bulky, did not have this expectation from moto. Screen clarity also not so great.  Expected better product from moto."
9720,5,Everything is perfect except battery. I really love all the features. I recommend these phone to all. Battery Capacity is not good from my exceptation.
9721,5,"I love moto phones by its gestures and it's more than average tough body than other smartphones. This time I purchased moto again because of its good quality plus fast charging and no bloatware (Bloatware is commercial software that is preinstalled on a device by the manufacturer, whether it's useful or not, and tends to waste memory and resources. While some of these apps may be useful, the majority of them simply sit there taking up storage space and in some cases, affecting the performance..."
9722,5,"Moto G30 is overall a budgeted smart phone. Its camera is lagging for 1-2 seconds when u click pic. Also it doesn't have a auto adjustment brightness feature. I had read in other people's comments that display is not upto the mark, but i felt display is nice and smooth. Finishing is awesome and mobile didn't feel heavy also. One can go for it rather than going in MI or realme having short life span."
9723,3,"I bought moto g30 and there are mainly 3 reasons not to buy it. A) 720p screen, like no one wants that.. But good enough for spare phone. B) There is no way to change SOS calling, on pressing the power button 3 times by mistake the phone will call the emergency helpline, mine does it once a day. Thanks moto. C) They have a secondary physical button which summons the Google assist, there is no way to remap it, it's totally useless. It's fine as a temporary phone or a backup phone, it can't be..."
9724,4,Value for money. Gesture feature is fun. Hey Google works like a charm. Power button position accidentally turns of phone. Display & sound are good for what you paid. Camera is ok. Charging is fast. Go for it if want all rounder under 10k

9727,4,Using Moto for 6+ yrs. Ideal for normal users at this budget with clean UI. Same model with 6 GB RAM variant could have made this much better option to choose compare to other brands.
9728,4,Don't expect much. Camera is good in outdoor but struggle in low light. Battery is good enough for one full day. Performance is above average. It is a value for money product. Far better than '12' in similar price range.
9729,5,"Best look, perfect camera with n number of options, perfect battery backup, sound is just too awesome seems like I'm playing on speakers, screen size is big, came with a back cover in the pack. Perfect option under this price range."
9730,5,"Camera is average...If you are not the one who is camera centric then I think it would be desirable to buy moto g30. Display is dull compared to other smartphones in this range. Battery- It is giant and nobody can beat moto with respect to battery performance. Gesture add on is a unique feature of moto which is praiseworthy. No heating issues, long battery pack up and fastness of this phone is what attracted me most. Overall a good buy."
9731,5,"It is nice but expected a better performance, because motrola is a very good brand . But this is good phone so guys go for it."

9735,5,"Motorola phones are underrated perhaps because they do not do publicity like few trending brands in the market. The UI is clean free of bloatware so less background process running increasing battery life and speed. RAM management is excellen, moto shortcuts are excellent and very very hand. Build quality is good. I have few other moto phones running without any issue after even 4 years of rough use. The camera is average and could be improved.

The camera clarity and the video clarity has been excellent. Cost fitted my budget well. Has additional features like screen recording, call recording among others. I am very happy with the mobile and as well the delivery service by Flipkart!!"
9737,5,Its a decent phone for everyday use and performs well for normal usage and i feel the battery backup is pretty impressive as i gifted this to my dad who is pretty happy with it and due to close stock android no ads or malware are bugging my dad so it is pretty neat and user friendly i can say.

Display is not the best like you get in flagship phones but yeah considering the price point it is definitely at par with the devices in this range.  Processor is more than enough if you're not a pro gamer and every other task feels so smooth. Infact the entire device feels fast in daily normal usage.  Google has taken care of every small detail like haptics, microphone, speakers minimalistic ..."
9743,5,"This new phone looks great , main advantage is bloatware free software and battery backup.Its now running on android 11 out of the box.It really gives 48gb free space for you out of 64 gb after installing OS.In 11,000 price range with all other features is good value.Make sure to use back cover and tempered glass when using this phone,it will work great after this. Disadvantage is hybrid sim slot."

9790,5,This thing has all the acquired characteristics of Moto G family except weight. Based on my experiences with Moto G3 and X Play devices this could be a bit more simpler in matters of usability. It is appreciated even though this bulky and heavier design is an R&D deviation with higher focus on Camera and Graphics. Camera is good in capturing details. NFC as well as sensors used are at par with the pricing. Live caption too works fine. Feels nothing bad for usual graphic apps but battery drain...

Previously I was using MotoG5s+ which had almost a complete day battery power even after 3 yrs of use, but this device hardly survive for 12hrs. 2. Slow charging. Since Motorola is providing Turbocharger, but I don't know why it takes about 4 hrs to charge fully, and discharge within 7-10 hrs. 3. Camera quality.

And since moto is the only phone with stock android, had to purchase."

It has a 64MP AI quad camera which captures the worst quality pictures and it is literally slower in performance and hangs quite a lot. It overheats quickly and even though it has a 5000MAh battery it doesn't last that long. I'm very very disappointe..."

I like Motorola in providing near stock android experience. Thanks for keeping that while most of the brands comes with lots of junk apps. I personally like moto action, and display features. Really useful. Charger is just okay. Except camera and charger It's a good choice. I will write detailed review later"

10332,4,"Very average camera, one stare less for camera quality. Though 64 MP Quad camera, I feel camera quality less than I expected. Performance wise all good. I rather bought G10 Power than G30."
10333,5,The best
10334,5,This phone is okay in its own divinity. But Buying this phone is a complete waste of money. It's not upto the mark of value for money because it's costly for its price and for the phone in the class of its performance shouldn't be as costly as it is. Motorola is a well known company and they should work on the camera of this phone. My Moto e7 plus having 48MP quad camera snaps better picture than this G30 which has 64MP camera. It's so sad that I had to venture in to this phone. Please guys l...

10351,5,Very good mobile
10352,5,"MOTO has developed so well in the last two years that it is now an alternative choice. Even my whole family now prefers MOTO over MI. Besides, salutation to FLIPKART that they are now selling MOTO phones so well and not to mention their delivery."

10365,5,Just okay
10366,4,good
10367,3,"Given the previous Motorala Models, this is better in comparison. But still not upto the market standards"
10368,4,"This mobile is not for the ones who want to use it for gaming, other than that 90HZ refresh rate really makes it smoother to use and performance is really great and battery sometimes lasts for 3 days. Go for it if you doesn't want to use it for gaming. It would've been 10/10 of they had provided us with 1080p display."
10369,4,Camera quality needs to be improved

Good gaming phone ,you can play in only medium settings for max performance. ..."
10427,4,"Phone is very bulky and heavy, even though screen size is 6.5 there is extra space at top and bottom which makes the phone look huge, and also design and looks wise it is not great. But definitely it is worth the price as it's performance, battery, camera are decently good"

It's gets a little bit hot while playing games and considerably hotter when playing games like call of duty maybe that can be fixed with software updates. The pricing could be a little bit more aggresive. By any chance if u can get it under 10...

10445,4,Mobile performing good. Good battery backup. As you know stock android give you a best experience of android. But phone camera is disappointed. Camera performance is below average in comparison of other same range mobile.

10457,3,"While the phone is good, the battery is woefully inadequate. The new phone charged to 100% doesn't even last for a day, that too without much use. Phone is bit heavy, but manageable. Stock Android is an advantage over other budget phones."
10458,4,"My only concern is the weight, still waiting for mobile like moto x4. Less Mah but quality and look was top notch."

10492,5,"Totally worth it, I have used moto g, moto g4 plus and this one. Excellent value for the price. I wouldn't say it is the best quality but can definitely use it for 2years.  USB C is not 3.1, it is still 2.0. You cannot really use all functions of usb c such as connecting to a bigger screen through hdmi cable. It is just a minor thing though."
10493,5,Awesome.....
10494,2,Camera quality is very baad. Its not 64 mega pixel.

10516,5,"Nice phone,superb battery backup go for it."
10517,3,"Internet speed is low , do not work as i expected Dont buy if you use for browsing ."
10518,4,Camera pulls the package down always in low range moto phones! Everything else is good in this device. Bit bulky! Overall for basic use it's a good purchase. Bang for buck! Battery display and performance is üëå
10519,5,Best mobile üì≤
10520,5,"Phone is working perfectly fine. Camera could be little improved, hope they give software update to rectify it. Overall it's budget friendly and best valued in this price range."
10521,5,Good product
10522,4,Posting the review after a week of use. Overall a good budget phone for this price. Phone is sleek and looks elegant. For a 64 MP camera the picture quality is not that great but takes good clicks in daylight. Lenovo should improve the focus on its cameras though. Phone works fine in day to day normal usage. Snapdragon 662 chipset works well and you don't see much lag. You can buy it for normal usage in this budget segment blindly. üôÇ
10523,3,Camera is bad
10524,4,Product is good but while in a cal after 15mins it gets heated thats why i rated 4

10536,4,Best quality products
10537,4,Camera's need to improve
10538,5,"No Oleophobic coating on the screen or atleast a screen protector is a bummer for me for this price.  Camera performance in not upto the mark. They say 64mpx but the pic quality is like that of a 13 mpx camera, which needs an update sooner."
10539,5,Excellent
10540,4,nice phone
10541,5,Very nice Moto

10547,3,Gud
10548,3,"Camera struggles a lot to focus on text of a document. Really bad and unexpected. 1 good thing I noted, it blurs background of a object in clicks, throws some extra focus & depth that enhances the object view. Check in pic. Battery could have been better, screen felt average or ok. Display is again just ok"
10549,5,Must buy no other phone is better than Moto I have started using Moto phones since G4 plus have launched. Trust it blindly and in this range what else you expect..

10561,3,"Battery doesn't last even for a day with moderate use. I don't use this done for gaming or streaming, moderate number of calls and microsoft teams for official purposes still the battery hardly last for a day. Low light performance of camera is poor, but gives good results in proper lighting. Camera and youtube crashed multiple times.

10576,5,Good
10577,3,not so good in camera and display
10578,5,Best Mobile under 10000
10579,3,"Overall this phone is good for basic usage , but battery got heat up once start playing game or internet surfing for more than one 1 hour. If u are buying for basic stuff like texting or calling..then go for it."

10590,5,Good experience with Moto mobiles. Super mobiles at lowest price
10591,1,Don‚Äôt expect much from the camera and performance ..as Flipkart didn‚Äôt arrange my return had no option but sold the device ... even though 665 processor but it was slow in shifting through apps.
10592,3,Writing this review after using moto g30 for 10 days. The battery is good. It last almost two days after normal uses. Camera is not good specially the front camera. The phone is little heavy. Just good enough for normal uses not recommended for photography.
10593,2,"Don't but this phone camera is very bad , Display also Dull , lagging issue also we have purchase this phone for my dad purpose but on 1st day we will find this much issue compare to redmi note 10 the camera is very bad 64mp but look like China phone camera blur also,Don't waste your money for this budget better go to redmi 9 powder / note 10"
10594,4,Camera quality is not good and but other wise all features is good.
10595,2,If others call me will said switch off
10596,3,Camera is not that great. 6gb ram version would have been preferred.
10597,5,Good
10598,4,Wow wow
10599,5,"awesome, bloatware ad free experience"
10600,1,Display is really bad. Brightness level is very low. Unable to see anything in sunlight even after putting maximum brightness. Seller is providing replacement only. Worst customer support from Flipkart. In future I will rethink before buying a product from FLIPKART.
10601,1,Slow charging.... Poor cemara quality....
10602,5,"In time delivery, and friendly behavior of the delivery boy. Highly impressed."
10603,5,Value for money. Lag free performance. stock android experience is good.
10604,1,"Don't buy any kind of product from Flipkart, the product they have given is faulty and 7 days replacement policy also not in used.  Very worst experience with customer care.  Regards, Pravin"

10609,4,"In this price segment ,it is a good phone"
10610,4,"The phone looks good, but flipkart exchange policy is very bad. Despite software in working condition, due to discoloring of pixels the phone got rejected."
10611,1,So poor. I want to exchange this set.üò†
10612,1,"Phone has multiple software bugs ;  abnormal battery statistics n draining, GPS n NFC keep getting ON & OFF automatically, very poor RAM management, no option for receiving incoming calls ( sometimes ), very poor network connectivity ( I've only Jio & Airtel ),  Finally no proper response from Motorola Team, as if they were in a Jiffy to launch this model.  Don't know anything about camera, since I seldom use smartphone camera."
10613,4,Value for money and this price segment is best option..and better than realme .redmi. mi. Vivi..and oppo
10614,3,"Camera average...Motorola should improve,not just launch products for competition...   Motorola is bigger brand ,hence should focus to give quality not quantity."
10615,1,Dont buy this phon camera quality is very very poor   Best of money

10617,3,Good
10618,4,Good budgets phone with 2 weaknesses 1 display 2 processor
10619,3,Display is not so good. Rather opt for a fhd display of poco at this price. Performance is no doubt good. But the device has a heating issue when charging. The device and the charger both gets heated up. Value for price of course. But it could have been better.
10620,4,Nice a photo
10621,4,Camera can be fixed by some settings you get a decent pic Battery performance is good and its last for one and half a day. Performance is excellent for day to day use.. Built is quite heavy due to big battery but get use to it after some day. Stock android phone... And with one weak of use its worthy and u can bet on it... Not for those who are selfie addicted üõë
10622,3,overall good..

10656,2,"The phone I received is having very fast battery drainage and heating issues while charging. When I requested for replacement, the Flipkart team arranged a technical visit to check whether my phone actually has problems & according to their policy, they replace the phone only if the battery drains 15% while recording a video in HD for 20 mins.

10657,4,Everything is soo good but it heats a lot. While charging it heats up to 43 degrees Celsius. Other than that its amazing. It would be better to buy it after you verify once. Later after some days it will be fine and performed good. It's good at this point
10658,5,Nice one
10659,5,Used moto g30 for a week I would rate: 4/5 for camera 5/5 for battery 5/5 for performance 5/5 for display 20w fast charger is also give in the box And for 11k it's worth buying this product

It takes nearly 3 hrs to charge from 0% to 100% with its 20W charger. I think Moto should have provided more powerful charger. Heating is not an issue.

Camera is not at all bad, it clicks decent photos, it takes some time to prepare the image and after that the photo becomes pretty good, both the rear and back camera are good according to me.  Display size and display quality are pretty good, it gives a nice feeling watching movies or videos on this device.  There are a few minor draw backs though these are not deal breaker.  1.

Camera performance is not good comparing to other phones in the price segment. Missing quick charge in the big battery of 5000mah.  Snapdragon 460 is very efficient enough to handle to basic stuffs."
12767,4,We can't expect more than this from a 8000 Rs phone... Since it is moto and they claim 48MP rear. .the camera could have been better...currently it is likeb5 mp...an update may fix this...

12778,4,Value for money nice
12779,1,Plasticky feel on body and missing back button on home screen is one the biggest disadvantage while using it in one hand it irritates that every time you need to swipe the screen from left side of the display and it gets worst when you text on whatsapp. Camera quality is very poor the pictures taken from this camera doesn't look like it has taken from 48 MP camera. I have also noticed that the flash light gets on while calling or receiving calls.

12808,5,Good
12809,3,Although the stock android experience is amazing it is to be noted that the reception on the phone is very weak given the fact that other phones give much superior results with the same sim.  A big flaw since that's the prime goal of a cell phone.

It's fast, bloatware free and you can do little bit of gaming with low to medium settings. Battery backup is excellent more than 2 days but charging could have been better. I got a good deal with exchanging a old mobile phone. So I'm happy with this purchase. Not recommended for hardcore gamers or camera lovers, a big NO."

13660,1,I got the mobile today. It is the worst mobile you will ever buy. Worst camera. Video calls are worst. You can compare the video and photo quality to any phone you are using and you will b highly disappointed.Don't waste your hard earn d money. You can not return the mobile once you switch on the mobile. You will feel cheated and you won't be able to return this product.

13704,5,With Moto E7 plus you will get the Value for money and a strong belief of Motorola as there has been no complaints on Moto devices since I had one for my mother before this so I opt for Moto again without thinking of anything for her this time. The best part of this device is its premium feel in this range with the solid packaging of the device qhen you use it continuously. It has a stock Google Android experience with updates directly from Google for the next two years similar to all stock A...

13708,3,With this price range it's a good phone but the face recognition doesn't perform at well in low light and the rare cam doesn't perform at 48 mp instead it works on 32 mp. But for call and video watching and social networking it's doing well. Can't handel heavy games like COD but doing great for candy crush and angry bird. Now upto u. For minimal gaming it's good .
13709,5,Very nice camera & battery backup
13710,4,"Value for price , camera quality is not good."

If you compare same configuration mobiles from other brands this is the best one as this mobile offers 48MP Camera, 5000mah, 4GB RAM, Clean UI and mainly Snapdragon 460.

14053,2,The camera quality is more like a 4.8 megapixel not at all a 48 megapixel Both rear and front camera are too bad
14054,4,Good purchase in 8000rs.. Good quality build.. Body is enough hard and not easily brokable Better option to ban China Mobile
14055,4,Good phone for this price
14056,4,Little heavy
14057,5,Nice phone but front camera is not good. It's only 8mp.
14058,3,Awesome
14059,4,"Pros 1. Better camera quality. Can capture any color including red, pink, orange, green (any shade) 2. Better battery (runs for 4 days, moderate uses including social media, online shopping etc) 3. Rest are same as others  Cons: 1. Weaker network signal. Facing issues when taking over phone call or video call over mobile data.  This is the major issue otherwise everything is good"
14060,3,Camera is very worst
14061,2,I bought two mobiles at a time but one out of two is defective opening appliacations automatically
14062,5,Thanks a lot to ekart for early delivery. They increased my exchange value which was unexpected. So thanks again to flipkart. Value for money mobile and meet my expectations as per the price. So no complaints.
14063,5,"Phone is value for money ,only thing i am not happy with flipkart exchange policy, at the time of order exchange value for my old mobile was 2800 but at the time of delivery they reduced it to 1100."

14090,2,Camra quality very bed
14091,3,1. The major disadvantage for camera : That's giving 3 star.. - Clarity wise 48 MP amazing.. - Selfie camera not super.. Just Ok - When taking photos after clicks using finger print sensor the photos not captured. Actually this is very common and existing feature for old and new model android mobiles. But still moto not updated in these type of common features ..need to update these feature. - When taking photos capturing is too slow...this problem is occurred smart phone initial releases .....

As per the Flipkart terms & condition the maximum value Rs 2,150 & minimum value Rs 950. I am not having any problems & damage of my mobile phone. They are doing presure on us the mobile is damaged we cannot find any fault in it This is totally cheating with us."
14109,4,"Phone is Good, but please don't buy mobile from Flipkart and i really had a very bad experience with Flipkart delivery and exchange of my old phone. Though my old phone is perfectly fine they did reduced the exchange value. I never expected such a low class approach from a highly valued ecommerce site like Flipkart. AVOID buying from Flipkart."

Phone is for average use, Screen is long, battery backup is average is not up to 5000mah, camera resolution is 48 mexa pixel is totally rubbish. Earlier Moto camera of 8MP is far better than48 MP, screen touches is average. Manufacturer are cheating consumer on 48 MP camera there is no any quality check. Think before to buy it is better to purchase from market. They shows demo of every items."

14181,4,Phone is good but nowadays phone screens are too big. We can call phones tablet lite version. Not handy Night vision camera is too good. But day light images are ok ok. Rest all is good but little bit heavy. I request motorola to make handy phone because moto phones are too heavy and strong plus big screens make the phone little bit unhandy....

14198,4,Best pure Android mobile under 10k (I bought it for 8100) without any add or unnecessary apps. Super camera. Overall good. Only one thing is low power charger. Better to buy higher power charger to charge quickly.

Other features: Motorola has given there one of the best phone in this price range. I have been using it now for more than 20 days and I am impressed. It have notificatio...
14206,5,Best phone in this price
14207,5,Best budget phone in this price
14208,4,"Best budget phone, but face unlock is not good. Every morning it shows to unlock the phone through pin, pattern, password"
14209,3,Moto's credibility for its build quality is degraded with this device as it's screen cracked at top right corner and with few week of usage there is lots of scratches visible without protection screen. Battery life is also quite poor even with 5000mah battery. Screen display is usable and device performance and camera is good considering the price segment.

Quality of camera is not this much satisfied. 13MP of e4 plus is much more good from this one. Same for battery backup. In both mobile battery is 5000 MAH. But backup in very much good in e4 plus. My suggestion is, if you are planning for buy this one than I recommend you should go with moto e4 plus not with e7 plus."

Battery and sound in good for this price. Have to accept the fact it is a low budget mobile. Even though the configuration and performance not met as they mentioned.7k is ok price for this one
14345,5,Overall superb mobile at this price
14346,4,Camera will disappoint you.. images are soft and not sharp for both rear and selfie cam.. night vision is also okayish.. 48 MP is only for attracting the customers to buy it
14347,3,Product is good but delivery was late
14348,1,Bad camera of back side..it has mirrarcast problem in all phones..I think some of money will west to invest.. My suggestion is don't to buy did product

14365,5,Nice product. All are good
14366,5,"Excellent, price worthy"
14367,5,Best phone ever with no junk under 10k with new Snapdragon 460 processor and solid body.
14368,5,Nice model for mid range users...
14369,5,Better
14370,1,Camera is cheap
14371,4,Front camera quality was not that much good quality.. Over all ok for the money.
14372,4,Everything is good under this price range except for the USB type B port. It does NOT have USB type C. And doesn't have turbocharger included. Has a basic charger.
14373,4,"Overall good phone for it's price range, Motorola is trustworthy brand , and more importantly this phone is made in India, that is biggest plus point. It may show little glitches sometimes. I also needed to change that gesture navigation feature, it makes phone painful to use, You can change to three button navigation from settings. To add back button go to settings>system> gestures>system navigation>3 button navigation. It will solve your problem."

14391,1,"Don't buy this phone, in this phone brightness is very low quality, front camera is very poor. Battery backup is also of poor quality."
14392,5,Ok Ok
14393,5,Nice phone...
14394,5,Well I have been using this phone for quite a time now and i can tell that it is the best non-chinese smartphone in its range .The battery backup is working incredibly and till now the 10W charging is also not much of a trouble haven't tried 0-100 but it did charge the phone from 47 to 89 in 22 minutes which is finely appropriate.The performance is incredible but it does take some mere seconds for loading the apps after you restart the phone but again watching the price range its fine.Talking...
14395,1,I hate network speed this phone give some updates
14396,5,Good products üëç
14397,5,"Super, Value for money.."
14398,5,Most mind choice mobile
14399,5,Stock android no bloatwares and a decent camera. All in all a good buy.
14400,5,Great product for this price tag!
14401,4,Good in price
14402,5,Budget king
14403,4,"Camera Quality is not so good, I'm using Moto One Power currently with 16MP rear camera but Moto One Power camera is too good in comparison to 48MP of MOTO E7 PLUS."
14404,5,"So I brought this one in Big Billion Day sale and: PROS: 1. Smooth texture experience. 2. Playing media quality is great. 3. Calling quality is good too. CONS: 1. Battery backup quality has started deteriorating in just a few days. 2. Forget heavy gaming, cannot even handle moving big files or any other heavy RAM use activity. 3. Camera quality is too poor for a 48 MP camera. 4. Allows only 2 sims (without SD card) or a sim and a sd card. Doesn't have 3 slots for idk what reason."
14405,5,Awesome product
14406,2,do not buy completely waste this product
14407,5,Just awesome
14408,4,It is amazing mobile
14409,5,Nice but company should provide earphones also
14410,4,Alike professional
14411,5,Look wise very smart phone i give 5 star
14412,4,"Everything is good at affordable price. Two drawbacks as per my observation. 1. We can't able to insert 2 sims and memory card at a time, either we can use 1 sim and 1 memory card or 2 sims only. 2. In setting there is short cut option for mobile data changeover and all. Next SMS can be sent only with a single sim, if we need choose sending sms it need to he modified in setting only. 3. Screen looking dull but there is no strain for eyes, comfort feel is there."
14413,5,It's a perfect product for elderly use. It can't be used for heavy usage but it's perfect for daily use considering the usage and price it's probably a good option. If you need it for basic use and not for gaming and all go for it but it can't handle heavy usage.
14414,5,Good mobile

14536,3,"Camera is crap. Display is also bad. Good things are like bloatware free almost stock Android experience, big battery with 64 GB storage. It's not a value for money product compared to other offerings at this price point. Mi & Realme can offer more value. You can go for this phone only if you're a stock Android fan & you don't wanna use custom UI."

Bit surprised to see, the package didn't contain a headset, eventhough the device supports 3.5 jack 2.) Would have been nice, if there was a dedicated memory slot, rather than messing up with the 2nd sim slot.  My intention was to upgrade my Nokia feature phone which I bought in year 2012 which is still in working condition, with its original battery and so on. Ex..."

Can't use net while calling. 2. Camera not upto the mark. 3. Body to screen ratio not optimised. 4. Slow net connectivity. 5....

14667,1,"Cons: 1. You can't use internet while you're on a call, that means there's no dedicated inbuilt modems. (These inbuilt modems are pre-installed and are available even on low-end smartphones, never expected this from motorola)  2. The camera's clarity and efficiently is not upto the mark. (Even my brother's RedMI 5A is capturing photos with more clarity.. but this doesn't seem like a 48MP camera, and auto capture is so embarassing with it's delayed recognition.  3.

Mobile Touch is also good. So if you are looking for good specification phone from 8K-10K, this is nice phone. Go for it..... Request to Moto, they should provide at least phone front screen guard with the mobile."
14706,4,It's good but length is big to hold in hand. Hybrid sim slot is a drawback.. u can put one sim and 1 memory card only. .if u want to put another sim..need to remove one of them.. Gesture mode also there..good some times

14710,5,I bought this phone in the flash sale and it works amazingly. The screen is long and beautiful. It does feel a bit heavy at start but you do get used to it in a day or two. The camera works quite nicely given that this is a budget phone. You get absolutely everything in the least price and a fantastic performance. Go for it.
14711,4,Nice phone middle range
14712,1,"Worst phone ever....camera is not even 8 MP.... front camera has 3GP quality so that one can go 10 years back. No support from Flipkart, the seller and Motorola...this phone is just dumb... do not buy this phone, I repeat do not."

14731,1,Very poor camera inspite of 48 megapixel look like 13 mp and no back options. Front camera unsatisfactory. Heavy phone inspite of 180 GM feel like 200gm. Display very poor as compare to Chinese phones. Finger print and processer slow inspite of 4 Gb ram. I am using POCO 4 GB ram much better 7499/-fully satisfied.

14760,3,"The look of the phone could have been more better by keeping screen sixe to 5.8, could have been slim if reduce the battery to 3500. The back camera design with mate kinda finish is awesome. One of the best phone in this prize range."
14761,4,"First of all i was suprised because it was more than the size which i expected.. And the display keep justice to the price. Battery : once its full charged it will last for a full day. Eventhough its a normal charger but works decently Camera : spot colur option is unique, portrait mode works well at day light, night capture is above avarge Overall expercice is worth for the money if u are looking for a budgetfull fun with some needfull features go for it"

14770,5,Camera clarity like 8mp. Nice products
14771,4,the product is a good budget phone for casual work and not heavy games. you can play heavy games but that would shorten the life of your device. if youre on a tight budget and want a phone for your daily work then it is for you. Hardcore gamers stay away. Camera is decent but the stock android feel and no bloatware is definitely a huge thumbs up for motorola.

14922,2,Camera quality is very poor
14923,4,"1. High build quality 2. Pure android without bloatware 3. Promising performance from Snapdragon 460(excluding heavy gaming) If you are looking for those qualities, albeit this one is best. Though motorola is owned by Lenovo, motorola still operates from United States. So, don't worry about safety. Everything is ok with this phone. But the battery backup is a bit low considering 5000mah capacity. Although it lasts for a full day."

15067,5,Looking for good and reasonable neckband from so long and finally got these super cool mivi collar classic neckband in such a great price rate  ¬∞ sound and bass quality is too good ¬∞ excellent battery backup ¬∞ loved the quality of the product ¬∞ comfortable ear fit even after using for a long period ¬∞ lightweight but strong wires ¬∞ and the best mic quality during calls which I was looking from too long  Much recommend product buy it without thinking twice
15068,5,This one is quite well built and I just loves the audio output at this price point. It's looks premium and stylish. After usage i surely say that it has a good battery life and also support fast charging. Recommended this one for long term usage.
15069,5,Definitely a great product. Design and build quality is really good and so is the bass of this neckband. Really loud yet the sound is really crisp. What makes it really a best recommendation is that it is priced below Rs 1000 and comes in so many colour options. Go for it without a second doubt!
15070,5,Very nice product.Love the sound quality and bass.

18078,3,Product is usable but do not expect too good sound and bass quality at this price. The build quality is poor so you need to be very carefull while using it.

18080,5,Great
18081,1,Bad earphones
18082,1,Worst quality
18083,5,"I got it for Rs.171/- and at this price the product is at its best. nice sound and very light weight. it claims extra bass but it also depends on your mobile and the music app you are using. It also matters the bass or equalizer setting of the app. so, it's a nice product and if it lasts for even six months, I would be happy because how much you can expect when you spend just Rs.171/-?"

20547,3,"Using for 2.5 yrs. Average product. but its not same as seen in the picture. It charges within 1 hr. Drains in 5 to 6 hrs. Good sound quality. Nice screen touching. Camera is ok . Delivery is one day before they told. Bluetooth connection is more good than other low rated watches. Watch quality is less, strap will crack and tear in jest 2 to 3 mnths. I m using 3rd party strap now. Clock face is very dull at sunlight. 2G sim is wrkng good with max 2hr on watch. Overall you want to handle car..."
20548,4,Nice but FB and WhatsApp as well as browser is for show only...no calculator and pedometer is fake but all Bluetooth features are available and working you can connect any headphone to it also it can support and card also. It's strap usually break after 2 to 3 months volume for music is high and recorder quality is fair. The sleep monitor is also fake. It is not splash proof . It is compatible with iPhone also. All around it is a moderate quality device I prefer buying fitness band for those ...

21056,2,Good product .... But how to insert sd card and sim card? Any ideas? quick response will be much appreciated.. thank you
21057,3,"Overall the look and the features are good, however I would like to highlight a few issues that I am facing.  The notifications do not appear, calls sometimes appear sometimes they don't, on the other hand inspite of linking the notifications for the msgs, the same is not working.  Battery backup is decent enough to sustain for three full days. The maps don't work properly, there is a lot of dependency on a good internet connection, but to what I understand the watch is connected with Blueto..."
21058,5,"Looks sleek, very comfortable to wear and yet to test it out for accuracy during walking or cycling my two main exercises but I feel it's a purchase which will be very satisfactory.  After using the watch for a while I can assure you its a brilliant product and has very good accuracy when it comes to covering step counts, calories burnt as well as heart rate. Sleep tracking is very good too and the fitbit app is excellent."
21059,5,I wasn't a great fan of activity monitors but the one thing that interested me to go for fitbit versa is i can load lots of songs and can go for my daily jogging with out needing to carry my phone. I connect my wireless ear buds with out any hassle. I'm not a fitness freak but once I got used to the activity monitor the data is helping me to be more active in the day. the fun part for me is to try hundreds of different free watch faces that suit to your taste. does everything that's mentione...
21060,5,"fitbit versa is looking absolutely great !!! No doubt at all.All features are good but payments were not supported for Indian version, hoping to get payment option soon. Best product at its cost range."
21061,5,watch is really good....i found very useful to track my activity....quality and built great for this price point...suggest to buy the watch below 15k whenever there is any offer....because then the value for money could be felt satisfactory
21062,5,Excellent product. Worth buying it. I personally suggest not to go for higher version for beginners who are planning to buy a smart watch. Apart from other cheap brands and entry level smart watches Fitbit Special Edition is best in looks and performance as well.
21063,4,Great product for the amount paid. Got it for 7999. Its amazing and works very well. It can even measure oxygen level. Thank you for such an amazing product.
21064,4,"Overall a good product as it looks and feels good on my wrist.  Pros 1. Looks good and stylish 2. Has plenty of apps that can be downloaded using the mobile app 3. Vibration with notification is very strong  Cons 1. Syncing with the app takes a while sometimes 2. I was not able to transfer music to the built in music app even when the watch was connected to a wifi 3. Even riding a scooter counts as steps, which is ridiculous"
21065,5,I ordered the peach color watch and it looks great the watch is rose gold and strap is peach colored. looks great on wrist and has good features.. setting up and configuring was smooth. Till now no issues per se. Delivery was fast and without glitch. Product was also defect free.
21066,4,"Great value at this price point, though I was expecting little more battery power along with few basic features like spo2, stress meter etc which are missing.  The music section required a paid version of Spotify and again the watch won't itself play. Ut you would need to carry your phone along with watch with paid version of Spotify to just manage the control. I personally don't find this useful because if I have to carry the phone than I can mange the control from my phone of bluetooth ear..."
21067,3,not worth for money... couldn't able to get music /songs as specified.. no synch established for whattups.. calendar after all attempts post spending good time.. not worth to buy...
21068,4,"i am using this watch more than one month watch is good really helpful for those who are health consious . watch is looking perfect , heart rate sensor is also fine , tracking is also gud but one thing i feel about this is its screen .it is so small we are habitual of large screen and this watch has little screen u think fitbit should work on this ..and it straps and screen gurads also so expensive"
21069,4,I would have liked to give a 3.5 stars but there's no option here! okay so now the watch:- The watch is grt in terms of fitness related features like tracking and stuff!! my main use of the watch was to use it like an smartwatch. it works like half smartwatch at the most that i can say! Though it has great features the main problem that i faced was while connecting it to my phone (honor play) it frequently drops the Bluetooth connection every now and then!
21070,5,very beautiful smart watch.. and works perfectly..... this is my third Fitbit in family and from last 5 years we have been a part of Fitbit family..... no complain....I don't see the point of wasting so much money on apple watch when the same work is done and beside you won't need a apple cellphone to sync it is compatible with any operating system...... value for money..... only first syncing one feel takes 5 min rest it just glided
21071,4,"This is a very good watch I am giving this review after using it for one week, it looks nice display is good data I felt the data is pretty accurate. I got it during the sale and the price which I got it was worth taking it, however I was not sure that this watch is not compatible with all the devices. Before buying this watch I would recommend that you go to the website of fit bit and find the list of compatible device for Versa and then only buy it. No wonder thatYou may have to buy a phone..."
21072,4,"Surprised to get delivery from Flipkart within 2 days. Thanks Flipkart.. Really a good quality product from fitbit with accuracy in each function. Easy to operate OS, Crisp and clean display along more functions for a fitness lover makes this product a worth buy."
21073,5,"My wife wanted a smart watch which could guess the hours of deep sleep and also count her exercise minutes, she does different HIIT forms. I was a bit skeptical before buying it but she ABSOLUTELY loved it. This was an anniversary gift and i still hear of it."
21074,4,Every day I am falling in love with this versa... only concern is battery it doesn‚Äôt lasts more than 3 days.
21075,4,wonderful product
21076,1,PLZZ read this before Wasting your money. PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Flipkart. They are not ready for return process even if your product is worst. Flipkart is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy headache and problems then go there. Don't waste your time with Flipkart  Regarding Fitbit Versa Performance is very worst. Which is atomatically disconnected from the app and then act as a simple digital watch. Flipkart customer care to take thi...
21077,3,Used it for 4 days now its time to tell the pros n cons.Step counter is absolute fail. I had to ride 23km to work and it counted 2300 steps along with stats of climbing 29 floors which was hilarous. heart sensor works good. vibration is adeqaute to notify calls ans other notifications. dial size is too small those who are big guns consider trying it out on retail shops before buying it.. Wallet app doesnt seems to be availabe in India so NFC payment feature you can forget it. The app sto...
21078,5,awesome.
21079,1,Just don't waste your money on this idiotic product..it will make your life hell cos it will stop notifying you time and again..and only option to resolve it is reinstalling the app..you will end up doing it 3-4 times a day..bad just bad.
21080,4,Worth the price... does all it claims to do...and does it well
21081,5,good
21082,1,I had ordered 2 watches but returned both of them. This watch is good but FitBit android application is very bad no proper syncing and had a lots of problems with notifications. If someone is purchasing smartwatch then without notification and proper syncing its just a digital watch why will someone waste so much money on a stupid digital watch.
21083,5,Loved it
21084,4,Nice product nice batter life colour quality is very poor but Look's primium....
21085,5,"Yes, it is the best fitness tracker watch. Data is accurate. Yes GPS is missed, but you can carry your cell phone along while running or jogging. The tracker and App does get the job done. Display as they say is amazing, no matter how sunny is the light outside, you can view your info. People who want to track their fitness goal, I would suggest go for it."
21086,1,FitBit Stopped Working after 6 months of use. Doesnt connect to IOS or Android. Tried everything. Wasted all my investment on this watch!!
21087,3,steps are not accurate ..may be you have to half fold the count
21088,5,Wow great one i loved it totally
21089,4,The fitbit is good. A price around 6k would be better for this I think. although I do not think spo2 sensor is there in the device. The description is wrong.  Not a right practice to advertise something which is not there in the product. Should be changed or fix the product.
21090,5,Good to go watch . Quite light Weight
21091,5,"It is indeed an amazing fitness watch considering the price and all the features offered with it. And the extra straps are really useful, I had to buy aftermarket straps for my blaze after 2 years of use, but with the versa SE you will get total 3pare of strap including the one allready installed. And decent delivery by flipkart."

21093,4,1. U can listen to music through your Bluetooth headset 2. Takes approximately 30min to setup on wifi 3. Connect same wifi with phone and watch 4. For music upload in watch u have to download app in your laptop and select transfer music option in watch and wait to connect .Then just simply drag and drop songs and sync with watch 5. U have to take ur mobile while running because it has connected gps 6. U cant connect ur Bluetooth headset and watch together in Vivo z1pro 7. U have to on ur m...

21095,1,"BPM feature is not working, wifi is not getting connected, notification feature fails"
21096,1,they gave used product
21097,4,it's good.
21098,5,nice smartwatch..
21099,4,"Got it for 10,999 rs. Major problem with this is ""notification"" it never showed notification on my oneplus 6 phone. Highly disappointed!! rest everything is fine"
21100,1,"Changing opinion from 4 star to 1 star. After using it for one year, it stopped counting step, heartbeat & motion sensor stopped working, contacted it's CC they told me to factory reset it & again do setup, after doing the same for 10 time no change occurred, now watch is not starting & charging, after contacting they told me that your warranty is over & they suggest me to buy a new one, never expected such poor quality from world famous fitbit."
21101,1,"First it's not functioning properly. To be particular, i don't get notifications on phone properly. Two when I compare them with the watch which my friend purchased in US. It looks like replica. There is been alot of variance in quality."
21102,1,"the Bluetooth is very poor, synchronization gets disconnected very frequently, step count is also inccurate, app is very confusing, waisted my money, this is my last purchase from Fitbit"
21103,4,Good Product
21104,3,Amazing product but prize is very high. Coming to performance is above average Overall product is good ‚ò∫Ô∏è
21105,5,Nice product
21106,3,The connected phone notifications rarely work on this watch. Cannot see the messages nor the incoming calls. I have seen similar issue with charge 2. Tried every possible troubleshooting option suggested but couldn't resolve it.
21107,1,Not supporting for Notifications.
21108,4,Device looks and feels good. It functions well.  But...  Does not pair well with MI A3 device. Please make sure that you check their website for the list of phones that it can sync up well.
21109,5,Good product without any questions. Free apps are available up to date.
21110,4,Really liked this watch ‚ò∫Ô∏è
21111,4,nice watch but have issues with bluetooth connectivity. but still overall one can have it as a beginner.
21112,1,very pathetic watch only after two weeks of use its now showing blank screen and above all no service centre in India
21113,3,first check your mobile compatibility before purchasing one..Redmi not 5 Pro not compatible
21114,4,Happy to buy it in billion sale
21115,1,not support all mobile model
21116,1,Do not buy...not worth and they fool us saying no refund..warning in 1week watch glass will break if it thouch any wall or drop..for this cost and brand they should have improved the quality and more functions. so please don't buy and get fooled
21117,5,Awesome Smart Watch At This Budgets 4 Day's Battery Backup Thankyou Filpkart..!
21118,2,Don't ever buy fitbit watch'. If anything happens after one year they will say that as it is out of warranty so nothing can be done. You may buy if you can invest such a huge amount for one year. My watch is not getting connected with any mobile phone means i thing bluetooth is not working. Its better to buy some other watch which is not so costly. On help they says nothing can be done as it is not getting connected.
21119,4,this fitbit versa is awesome... i am using this snartwatch from last 15 days and I loved it... all functions are very good and accurate... only problem I had in the beginning while connecting with phone but now it is part of my daily routine...
21120,5,Got it at an amazing deal for 7.5k during big billion days. Thank you Flipkart.
21121,5,"Awesome product, fully satisfied..great product team fitbit.üëåüôè"
21122,5,It's a good watch.
21123,5,"Cool looks and good for technosavvy people!! Keeps records of heart rate, steps and many more, has bluetooth accessibility to all ur apps in the phone üìû. Displays all notifications and calls!!"
21124,1,"Once u lock ur device , and simultaneously unpair your device from mobile then u can never unlock that device for life time"
21125,5,I will divide this in pros and cons. Pros : 1. Screen brighten is good. 2. All the values shown by watch is appropriate. 3. Extra straps were good. 4 . Overall give you feeling of very premium watch. 5. I got it for 7500 so price is excellent. Cons: 1. Battery backup is not that much good (3 days).
21126,5,Excellent Fitbit for the price If you are looking for your first smart watch it a best choice Battery lasts more than 3 days Display is great Accuracy is near to perfect My experience first update is done by calling customer care which is also in Fitbit app which Is of great easy I like the most is we can add our photos as watch face with all info such as time heart rate etc
21127,3,The display glass of the watch is not worth the money. I have been using various watches all through my life. Right from HMT to Fossil. But this is the first time I bought a watch that chipped at the edges with just a light tap against the door frame. I have now worn a silicon screen protector. Also the strap broke in two months. One good fact is I got 4straps with this watch. Will never buy Fitbit watches again. Plain health bands are good but not watches .
21128,1,Very bad product. Don't buy it.
21129,2,I can not fix silicone black strap to the dail. Their is no notifications on watch and i am facing problems because of this
21130,5,"A gr8 watch with best discounts from Flipkart and fast delivery. Fitbit is the most reputed name in smart watches with accurate heart rate, sleep & spo2 tracker."
21131,5,Very nice
21132,5,This watch was Awesome
21133,5,Truly outstanding except the battery. The looks is superb.
21134,2,Don't buy this product none of the feature is not working in this product and waste of money
21135,5,Worth buying it
21136,5,It is a good product in this price range.
21137,3,Facing issue with connectivity and notifications access on mobile.
21138,1,"The Fitbit is not getting charged at all since last 2 days. Earlier on 25th April also same issue was faced, when we kept it on the charger for few hours and after few hours it started charging. But since last 2 days it not getting charged at all. We tried various options like putting the usb charger in laptop and differ power points but no avail. The quality of the product sent is really questionable. Poor quality product has been sent by dealer."
21139,1,"Worst product to buy, waste of money. after all the attempt to fix the sync issue it failed to do so. Bought an expensive new phone just to be compatible but still facing the same issue."
21140,1,Pathetic smartwatch. Displays wrong distances. Too much error in all features. Don't buy. Waste of money
21141,5,It's an amazing product
21142,2,"The Fitbit distance calculation is wrong. Eg:: when I walk a particular distance it shows 1 km, but when you run the same distance it shows 1.4km meters."
21143,3,"The major con is the battery life. If I just wear this the entire day without syncing with phone, even then I need to charge it once in 2 days. The claim of 4 days battery life is total sham. Deducting 2 points for that alone. My older GoQii used to give me a good week's life.  The 2nd major pain in the neck was adding music to the watch. It took a software update for me to realise that I wasn't doing anything wrong, it was a glitch in existing software.  It does a pretty decent job of tracki..."
21144,2,With heartbeat on battery backup is 1+ days Spo2 doesn't work Steps count is not accurate.
21145,2,Poor battery backup
21146,5,Best watch
21147,5,This watch is so good.And I can where it anywhere.
21148,4,Awesome üòé thank you flipkart for service
21149,5,Worth buy and accurate
21150,5,"Except the average battery life of 3-4 days max... It's awesome. Transferring of songs is bit of a hassle as one can only do it thru laptop. Light weight, touch control responsive. Got it for 7999/-. Worth every penny."
21151,2,Bettery keep charging every day
21152,2,After one year display automatically damaged
21153,5,Excellent product... Useful features for a lay person to collect data
21154,1,Worst product no recommended
21155,4,Good watch...looks stylish...
21156,5,Beautiful watch...value for money.
21157,5,Used for about a week now and completely satisfied. Great look and good battery life.
21158,5,Good one
21159,1,"At this price , I could have purchased better product , worst UI"
21160,3,Okay product
21161,5,Thanks flipkart for ontime delivery. Product recieved as described in description. Will write a review after three months if use.
21162,1,The watch stopped working as on March 1st 2021. Never expected this in less than 1.5 years from date of purchase.  Not sure if Flipkart is selling low quality products or the watch itself has an issue.  Either way very disappointed
21163,5,Awsome experience....
21164,5,Good watch
21165,4,"Great smart watch. cool looks. battery life is okay-ish, around 3 days. would love to see SPO2 sensor getting used beyond just sleep data."
21166,1,Unable to reach customer care. The product is not even used for a week now the battery is getting drained in less than 12 hours.
21167,2,Not good
21168,1,Waste of buying
21169,5,Nice watch
21170,5,Very nice product...üëç
21171,4,All good on the accuracy front. Battery life could have been better though .
21172,3,Item is ok bt not supported some apps
21173,1,"Persistent sync issues, pl don't buy"
21174,4,Its a good smart watch with all the necessary features. Highly Recommended
21175,1,Absolutely inaccurate in terms of distance. GPS connection is horrible. If you are looking for sports tracking then better choose Garmin or other chinese brands. Not satisfied with Fitbit's purchase. Wont recommend
21176,1,Very bad experience Connectivity is zero backup also poor
21177,5,Very nice smartwatch in low price!!!
21178,5,"Works great, got delivered on time. Step counter was inaccurate for a bit but nothing you can't fix. The battery lasts for 3-4 days on constant use without notifications. If you have notifications on then it will drain faster. You can't answer calls and texts on this but you do get notification, I personally don't find this feature very useful. Overall decent buy I'd say."
21179,4,All the other features are very good and they are as precise as promised by the brand. The only issue I think is the battery does not last not even for 2 whole days whereas I don't even wear it to my bed.
21180,2,"Incompatible with ios i guess.Sometimes it gets disconnected too. Even I‚Äôm using the latest verions,it shows up to update the app or watch OS to change the clock faces."
21181,5,Superb watch Lots of Clock faces Ok for Activity tracking 2day battery backup only
21182,1,Not good
21183,4,The watch is good. Has good functionality. Battery life is 4 days+. Delivery was fast.
21184,4,Good watch
21185,1,Don't buy.starts malfunctioning after 10 days
21186,1,10k worth product just given to watchman. Did not even ask pin. Product was opened and sealed with cello tape. Are you kidding me? It's a scam second hand product that's why it's cheap. Don't buy.
21187,4,Worth it....
21188,1,Waste.. it's getting hung all the time..not able to complete a workout..
21189,5,Nice
21190,5,Very nice watch in a quite reasonable price. Lots of features. Loving it. Working good.
21191,4,"Nothing can be better than this product , good deal on Flipkart , I will suggest to buy this product without any confusion"
21192,5,Good one if you donot mind connecting to gps of phone. Has 3-4 days of charge. Readings are fairly accurate.
21193,4,Good deal. Amazing! The package had 2 belts as mentioned. bought it at a good discount
21194,5,Great product!!
21195,2,Not value for money..
21196,4,Nice watch
21197,5,Amazing
21198,5,Its value for money
21199,5,Thank you flipkart
21200,2,The batter back isn‚Äôt good also sometimes it fails to light up when you turn you wrist and you can get better options in this price range
21201,3,1.There was a bit of lag in the software response in touch. The step counter had much difference to the negligible value of error. 2. Connected GPS didn't work well either. It was disconnected most time. 3. The wifi connectivity issue with the device was worst. Most of the watch faces were not able to be downloaded. 4. Notification delay 5. One good thing was that the watch is super light and awesome strap (woven fabric) kind. You don't even feel that you've worn it. 6. Detailed sleep analy...
21202,4,It‚Äôs okay
21203,1,"After few months of use, its not starting. Once its out of warranty its of no use if your watch becomes bad as there is no service center. You mail your probz to customer care they will just feel ""sorry for your inconvenience"" and nothing else. It means in short buying such premium smartwatch has a validity of just 1 year. Go for another brand if you wanna buy Premium smart watches. Disappointed with such products from such big brands. Just a loot."
21204,5,Good So far...Loving it
21205,5,Value for money (Accurate results at every point) look is awesome
21206,5,Very good
21207,4,Classic watch
21208,5,Good product
21209,5,It's wow
21210,4,Classy product.but battery issue seen
21211,5,Nice watch.....
21212,5,"Awsm product at awsm price , Completely satisfactory. Fitibit is the one u can count on"
21213,3,"The watch looks fine but extra strip can't use as it is little bigger then the original one , can you help me to change ...and replace with new strip"
21214,5,Nice
21215,2,Battery was a bit not satisfactory
21216,5,Nice one
21217,3,Pros- Premium quality Brand value Multiple functions Sleek look Good sensitivity  Cons- Display could have been better; one would expect a better display quality looking at the price of the watch and fitbit brand name attached to it. App interface not very good. Couldn't find the used watch faces.
21218,1,Not good at all. I jave returned the product same day.
21219,2,Don't buy
21220,4,"Hardware is good, but lot of premium features in app."
21221,1,The Product was used and the extra strap was missing and the main strap was also broken
21222,2,Not worth buying it ....screen flickering issue
21223,5,Wonderful bought at 7300
21224,4,Got it in Big billion sale. Positives: Very light . Good software from fit bit tracks all activities. Has an additional belt. Con's: Not the latest features. Many priced below have more features. Only basic steps and heart rate. Strap quality doesn't instill confidence. Plastic feel to the tracker. No GPS/Compass.
21225,4,"Nice watch,but no phone notifications to watch.what is the process to do that."
21226,3,Very often syncing issues and bluetooth connection problems as there are 2 bluetooth connections required.I am disappointed the rest of the watch works fine however the software issues just cuts away the feel and purpose of the watch.
21227,4,Delivered on time. Good one. Looks good.
21228,1,"After a year i al writing this review. I did not use the watch for a month since my strap was broken.. i switched on the watch after the month and it never worked. Tried all possible solutions given in youtube and fibit forum but no luck. Buyers never buy this Fitbit product no service, no support and no guarantee. Spend little more and go with Apple or some other brand.  Seriously the worst product i ever used."
21229,1,Within 8 months display issue started and now it's not working at all and no support from either side.
21230,5,I was very doubtful if this was a right choice. Now I would not regret. Received it today. Set it all up for everything.  Loaded about 100 songs and can play via bluetooth speakers. Best part is I am able to connect to my phone and bluetooth headset at the same time. No difference in quality of sound (actually better than mobile. There is no gap between songs.)  A little time consuming to set up but once done its good to go.  The only thing missing would be inbuilt GPS. Its got everything. No...
21231,5,"Good watch good in quality, precision.  But some how it is not allowing me to update the clock faces and the firmware update is not up to the recent one"
21232,5,Best at this price
21233,4,Good Simple watch.
21234,1,"The only function it does is what a fit band does. Then why pay 10 times more. The message notification function doesn't work properly. And gets removed repeatedly making you reset ur device again and again. The call notification works, but u can't answer ur calls as it doesn't have a inbuilt mic or speaker. It's a total waste of money. Total loss. Requesting for a refund. Also before you buy this product please check on fitbit app if it supports ur device."
21235,5,Nice
21236,5,Very nice üëç all features are nice
21237,5,Sweet techy thing to have... And pretty cute...
21238,3,"Battery discharges within 3 days. You need to pay extra for paid subscription to use the features, the features which are usually bundled with watch purchase."
21239,3,Bike/cycle travelling KMs is not giving if phone not carried. Battery life is also not that good.
21240,5,Pros: 1. Accurate 2. Great community 3. Customisation  Cons: 1. Sync is not all that great. Takes time to get sync 2. Battery drains much faster with always on 3. Accessories are costly
21241,1,I bought versa last year and now it gets problem in Bluetooth and service center not found. Even I have reset the versa but some problem persist.
21242,5,"A smartwatch that works perfectly with both android and iOS. Fitbit has nailed it completely with it's Versa range. The design is sleek, very useful for people who are health-conscious and it offers value for money."
21243,2,"It's not good it's not just complete one year and charger is not working and watch belt is also damage according to cost, material is not good"
21244,5,Very nice really good product
21245,1,Worked well for 6 months and then one day while in use heated up. Burnt the wrist because of battery heating issue.
21246,1,Don't purchase fitbit brand because this is Chinese product. My fitbit watch stopped working after 6 month as well they don't want to exchange.
21247,5,No doubt... It's best in class
21248,5,Good one
21249,1,After 45 days of use my watch stopped working.. it has been 4 months but my watch is not replaced. No response from customer care. Very bad experience.
21250,5,"Except for logistical delay, everything else was perfect for this pick"
21251,3,Not much as expected
21252,5,Best in rate awesome
21253,5,Best smartwatch in this prive segment. Period. ...
21254,5,Best in class
21255,1,Worst don't buy it
21256,1,Strap is not durable. Broken within three months of usage. Please do not buy from this seller.
21257,1,This product waste
21258,1,Waste of money . Won't work after 6 months.
21259,1,Waste of money.. doesn't connect easily
21260,1,Do not buy this watch.Waste product.Im unable to sync with my phone.Very pathetic customer support too ..
21261,2,Not worth of the price
21262,1,syncing problem with iphone
21263,5,Amazing watch!
21264,2,"Using since months, watch is okay ok okay but the notifications are not working. Tried all the settings they are sync for some time and got disconnected again. Not sure. Upto fitness tracker I was satisfied."
21265,1,Poor
21266,1,"Bought this in July, calorie counting is like wayyyyyy off it literally shows you more than double calories. I mean who burns 7000 calories after a 6 hour walk.  Edit: Horrible, stopped syncing after 3 months of usage fitness tracking was average but calorie tracking was horrible. No customer support in India. I got and Samsung watch 3 which works like a charm and is overall very accurate in terms of fitness tracking. Don't buy fitbit ever."
21267,5,The watch Is good every thing fine but within 6 months the strap snapped. It was used with utmost care but still the strap just tore.
21268,3,Breakage product
21269,1,The worst thing ever i got in my life. I would rather give minus star rating
21270,4,Watch is undoubtedly good. But the strap is not upto the mark... It tore apart in 4 months
21271,1,Very bad watch charging problem accessories problem and customer care not supported for your problem.zero marking
21272,2,"i bought this watch just bcoz im a fitness enthusiast and wanted to track all the daily routines including my phone notification. after 4 days of using this watch notifications of my phone (including whatsapp, messages etc) has been stopped. i reset my watch is about 3-4 times and the problem is still the same but only one thing which i really like that whenever you workout or do any physical activities, this watch gives you real numbers (including your calories, steps, heart rate, sleep ti..."
21273,5,Bad product Not reading heart rate after 6 months
21274,5,Good product received and worth of money.
21275,1,Totally inaccurate!
21276,4,"Good product, but don't work smoothly with android device"
21277,4,"Nice watch , looks nice but is not a true health tracker. It cannot distinguish between treadmill and walking . Also calorie burn is different from what other machines show"
21278,5,Great watch..durable too
21279,5,Loved it
21280,5,Nice
21281,5,Very nice and so satisfied. Thanks
21282,2,Money waste
21283,1,Look wise it's good...but not accurate. MI band is much more accurate and cheaper comparitively.
21284,5,Nyc
21285,5,Very good product
21286,4,Nice watch
21287,4,Nice product
21288,5,Perfect
21289,5,"it's amazing, just go for it"
21290,4,good
21291,1,not able to connect with mobile and not even getting notifications and calls on my smart watch.not even worth it really unhappy
21292,3,"The watch looks good but the only issue we are facing is with the App. Very often we need to clear the cache and re-login the app, after every login we have to set the notifications."
21293,5,Berry ghatiya product
21294,3,I was not satisfied with this product.. the item was not fair and call notifications will come and message notifications are not come
21295,4,worth to spend on this product
21296,5,perfect...i got very good deal for 9000...it's been 3 months and no issues so far
21297,5,amazing and well fit to customers requirement. best price it was with all other online website.
21298,1,"watch is not at all user friendly. there is no customer care to contact. Please do not waste your money. from the day one i have purchased, synchronisation issue with phone and once i done factory reset, then watch power off for life time. i can not power on from the date i have done factory reset."
21299,5,amazing product
21300,5,Worth it. To keep tracks of your activities.üòä
21301,5,Nice watch.. Gifted wife on our marriage anniversary and she loved it..
21302,1,dont buy this watch. worst product
21303,5,Supergood.
21304,5,best
21305,2,"Product is good. Asthetics are to my taste. Pedometer isn't accurate. If you're traveling in a bus, it will calculate steps due to sheer vibrations. Battery life is good if you are not using notifications or connected GPS.  Now the worst part - Fitbit doesn't have a single service center any where in the world. So if you damage this watch, you will have to buy a new one. Period."
21306,5,nice
21307,5,Papa is very happy with the watch
21308,5,Full stylish ‚ù§Ô∏è
21309,2,"belt looks decent, but does not fit with the watch pins. You won't be able to use it."
21310,5,Amazing!! You can make your selfie pic as a clock background which feels just so good.
21311,3,it has some of technical issues like notification problem and it take lot of time to load maps.
21312,5,"synchronisation issue, good one to use"
21313,1,battery life is a serious problem.. after on update the battery does not last for even one full day.. been using amazefit.. it's so much better than this one..
21314,5,super
21315,5,"The watch doesn't show the notification of call or message, it always says pair the phone even after pairing the same, raised this issue to Fitbit multiple times, but no response yet."
21316,4,Very nice Fitbit Versa Smartwatch
21317,5,great product
21318,5,I just have praises for this watch
21319,4,base users for a activity trackers
21320,5,loving it.
21321,4,"Overall a good smartwatch. 24x7 heart rate monitor, notifications.. working perfectly with Galaxy M30s. Only negative is step counter is inaccurate."
21322,1,my product is not returned yet. how can the issue be resolved
21323,1,"Connectivity is totally disgusting, notifications never work. Cheaper Chinese watches are better in this regard"
21324,5,Satisfactory product
21325,4,good in all aspects.
21326,1,There is a discolouration problem in 1 month. I am highly disappointed by flipkart and fitbit
21327,2,While calculating floors and exercise duration. It's highly inaccurate !!! So accuracy which is the main thing is major issue. Battery backup is good which is 3+ days.  Stopped working in 4 months only. And fitbit take a very very long time to replace your watch.
21328,4,ok
21329,1,"I am using this product from last 2 months, I am using oneplus 6 Mobile. 1) Connectivity Issues ( every time i use to go to settings and reconnect again) 2) Find My Device/Watch not available ( even MI band have this feature) 3) Only to view time and Fitness activities thats it. ( while going in bike also its counting the steps). Instead of this you can buy Mi Band to go with Fitness Activities and time."
21330,4,"Amazing product with one major flaw, it does not play stored songs properly through bluetooth speakers or earphones. The music either plays too fast or too slow. The only difference between versa and versa lite is versas song storage facility which in a way is waste as it does not play properly. save money go for versa lite."
21331,5,very good product...
21332,1,Connectivity issue.
21333,4,excellent watch...only issue is the charger has something inside which sounds something loose..but itz working
21334,2,The battery is not such a log lasting as given.lt give backup up to 80 hours
21335,5,super watch and nice color
21336,5,Awesome. Very Good watch in the category. Light in weight.
21337,4,good one
21338,2,"Not so great!! decent on external, very primitive inside!! light-years to catch-up with what Apple watch offers!! Except for the price, pretty disappointed!!"
21339,4,There is some variance between actual steps and fitbit count...but over all its a superb product
21340,2,very bad.step count incorrect always. waste of money
21341,1,not as expected. 1. Sleep data not correct. 2. Wrist belt is irritating. 3. poor battery. 4. many features are paid and synchronisation after many failed attempt. poor connectivity. .
21342,5,good product fantastic delivery and price by Flipkart thank you Flipkart
21343,5,good one
21344,5,good and accurate
21345,2,It does not have built in GPS and it does not calculate distance accurately. It also does not have walk option in the exercises.
21346,5,very good
21347,1,worst wate of money dont buy display problem with in 20 days it was dead
21348,4,Really good watch worth buying
21349,1,Got it for reasonable price on big billion day..Just after few days of usage the smart watch is getting synced but display is not working..Raised concern to fitbit and replacement order was placed.Did not expect such poor quality from Fitbit.
21350,1,"notification service does not runs on my device, always shows an error message in a red banner in the fitbit app"
21351,5,worth buying....
21352,1,Charger stopped working within 10 days of purchase. Please do some quality checks before handling the product
21353,1,No meeting my expectation as it is not compatible with one plus 5 and it is not mentioned on the app.
21354,3,working as per review but little costly
21355,3,watch is good but app not working properly.. some times i am not able to see notifications in fitbit..
21356,3,Not as expected due to connectivity issues that it has with my one plus phone. Otherwise it is fine but not a value for money buy as spending 8000 for this watch is waste. Could be a steal if available at 4k.
21357,5,nice product....
21358,1,Not worth the price. Step tracking is inaccurate. The band adds car and bike ride as steps. Didn‚Äôt expect this from Fitbit
21359,5,perfect for health reasons
21360,5,super product and delivery on Time üëç
21361,5,go for it guys rocking
21362,1,the Charger is not working and it‚Äôs only been 21 days since I bought it. I don‚Äôt want to recommend it. High risk
21363,4,excellent fitness tracker and a fancy watch
21364,1,In just 5 months this watch stopped working! Requested from Fitbit for replacement and the procedure is so confusing! Not worth the money paid
21365,5,Fantastic watch ..specially for fitness
21366,5,very nice watch received two days before the delivery date and awesome features .
21367,5,awesome product happy to buy this üëç
21368,1,Not good product. Starting for about 10days it was showing correct data. After that it show same results of bpm of all
21369,4,good
21370,2,it's not connected to mobile for calls and messages alerr
21371,1,is it compatible to one plus 5T...i am facing compatible problem.
21372,5,Wonderful Watch with wonderful price..
21373,1,it's not a smart watch which can receive or reply to phone call or WhatsApp message it's a normal fitness band
21374,5,great product
21375,2,"It doesn't feel like a premium watch. Also, the sensors that wake it up are less effective, One has to shake the wrist to wake it up"
21376,4,doesn't support notifications in one plus 6
21377,5,Very nice smart watch. I got in the big billion days . Delivery was on time.
21378,4,very good product with great features
21379,4,good watch.... only lacking call facility
21380,5,Loving this watch thanks to Flipkart for such offer.
21381,2,Counts steps while driving as well as just moving hand back and forth. Expected a lot better product at this price
21382,1,Everytime I'll have to update my watch and it takes like 5 years to update üò†
21383,1,expectation is more while buying but after wearing the smart watch it didn't reach the level very difficult to add a Bluetooth device and adding songs.....
21384,3,Everything is good except I received Chinese variant of the device and the connectivity issue with OP6T
21385,5,"Monitor whole day, involvement and monitoring is design perfectly that make you busy and conscious about losing weight burning calories , listing music as well as controlling breathing & BPM"
21386,2,The product was not as per expectation.
21387,5,genuine product
21388,5,Great product
21389,3,Durablity is good but walking step is not accurate
21390,5,Nice Watch for the Amount
21391,5,awesome.....
21392,3,"Unfortunately I couldn't get any option to get notifications in my Redmi phone..Kindly help..if it doesn't support ,then it will be a waste of money for me!"
21393,5,Excellent product... good to go
21394,5,nice product
21395,2,"i am kind of unhappy wit this , other features are good bt it isn't appropriate atall. sometimes it automatically increases steps while being on rest mode , the fun fact is i remove my watch and sleep amd the other day i see 500 calories burned like i didn't even wear it"
21396,1,Flipkart has provided me a faulty piece or the watch itself is faulty. It is not able to get the notification from my phone. Tried a lot. worst product
21397,1,worst watch
21398,4,stylish and fantastic
21399,4,ok
21400,5,excellent watch
21401,5,best price and good buy
21402,4,the reason why I am giving 4 is it is not syncing with my phone automatically.
21403,5,come with more than expected features.ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞love it.
21404,3,"delivery was so poor, item is nice"
21405,5,Good
21406,2,"Terrible setup experience. Nothing works seamlessly. And Linux is not supported for music uploads, etc."
21407,1,disconnects very frequently with my one plus 6 and then again takes 30minutes to add again ! and doesn't show any notifications! and delivery took 12 days ! worst buy ever !
21408,1,Not connecting for not working properly
21409,5,Nice product
21410,5,very nice
21411,1,Not fully compatible with one plus 6T. Having Notification issue.
21412,3,It's nice but it's Chinese variant
21413,5,Nice watch
21414,1,Very poor quality. Has completely gone dead in one day of usage after factory resetting. Wastage of money.
21415,5,Product is good....look and Activities tracking is nice.
21416,4,beautiful watch
21417,5,Trustworthy companion throughout the clock
21418,4,cool
21419,5,Best smart watch üòçüòçüòç
21420,5,nice product. have been using it for almost a week. got it at a good discounted rate on flipkart.
21421,5,good one
21422,1,"The product doesn't want to start unless the update is done. I spend more than half a day to sort it out, but never successful. In 2019 if few kb data will download forever, then I can't image the build quality. I was very excited for the purchase, but now I regret it"
21423,3,update is taking too much time and adding music to watch also little bit tough. screen resolution is not much. and sometimes connecting with phone also takes much time
21424,1,waste item
21425,5,got it for 7K best in the price range
21426,5,Beautiful and lightweighted watch. Came with extra pair of small and large sized wrist band.
21427,4,"The Watch is good, but the android app is so bad it took nearly 3 hours to update the watch"
21428,5,amazing
21429,1,"Expectations High but sad, not connecting With Bluetooth"
21430,5,"my product has delivered at timely.and i would like to this smartwatch.build quality and design is good,also packing is good.thank u"
21431,5,it's counting steps even while sleeping...its not worth
21432,3,"If like me, you are looking for a GPS watch, it isn't. It is a connected GPS watch which means GPS is connected via your phone. Hence you need to carry your phone will running which destroys it very purpose."
21433,3,"seemes like sent me a used product, the model is of 2017, I was suspicious as the price was pretty low, it works ok for now"
21434,3,"The Bluetooth connectivity goes away in short while. And the notifications does not show up in the watch, except the call. It asks to restart the phone, but even after that nothing changes. you have to install and uninstall the fitbit app every now and then which can never be a permanent solution.  So basically, I am not at all satisfied.  though the heart rate and the steps count is authentic."
21435,5,"Great fitness tracker, just that uploading music is painful. otherwise this is simply amazing"
21436,5,Good
21437,5,very good product n quick delivery by flipkart
21438,3,"Overall good product, step count is way off which should be the primary thing thus watch should do"
21439,1,item is not working. notifications is not working.
21440,1,worst product worst service
21441,5,"Best Smart Watch ever, love it"
21442,5,OK
21443,1,"Inaccurate step, floor count, tracks steps even while driving and sleeping. Not worth it."
21444,3,There must be Indian update also.... like Indian calender.....
21445,2,worst
21446,4,name is enough
21447,5,product really great . I am totally sctified this product .really good camera for beggner .but flash button was missing that is not good .and capture is 18 mp wasn't good I was hopeed it will be 24 mp . it is also missing .n everything is good .
21448,3,Satisfied with the product.. Its a really good for all who wants to learn photography its a gem and love.... Go for itt....10/10
21449,4,The camera simply awesome..and it is a best budget DSLR and begginer DSLR for first time user...auto focus mode works good in daylight
21450,5,Worth more than the amount. Best DSLR for a good beginner. Friendly camera. Love it. ‚ù§Ô∏è Extremely good with canon 50mm f1.8 STM lens.
21451,5,"product is very good and build quality also , special thanks to Flipkart for fast delivery , best camera for starters , it captures best quality photos"
21452,5,Awsm . I'm not a professional but using of li'l bit xperience must say that best Dslr in a best budget.perfect for a beginners.image quality is too good.thanx to Canon thanx to Flipkart & also thanx to Ecom xpress for perfect delivery.
21453,5,Verry Nice and for My Opinion is great camera For this Price Range. I love it my first DSLR...! üëç Lot of Experiments Is easy with This DSLR .üòé
21454,5,everything is perfect And specially the packaging it was so good .. When it arrived I got surprised because of the carry case I didn't expected that .. thank you so much Flipkart
21455,4,"Camera is good for beginner. But not getting that much high quality pics from this camera or lens. So I order canon 50mm just after my 1st vacation, when I was not satisfied with the quality.. Check you tube regarding the comparison of 18mm and 50mm lens. If you want to buy camera than only kit lens is not just you want from your pics. You have to upgrade with any prime lens,whether it's 50mm or 55-250mm. Thanks"
21456,5,excellent dslr and get a free moto headset worth 6500 I am happy
21457,5,Camera doesn't matter if you have skill you still click photos like this and lences also define your clicks but if you don't have budget then this camera is for you it is best camera for learning Photography but if you have a little more budget then try to buy at least 1300d or 1500d theses are not great cameras but better then 3000d
21458,5,"My first DSLR. good one for beginners. easy to use. worth for money. and as always, super fast delivery by Flipkart. loved it"
21459,4,"good camera n it's my first DSLR I loved it. But delivery took so long. I got camera bag, camera and lense, 16gb card, batter with charger lense cap and carry strap. good camera for beginners."
21460,5,it's clearly evident that's it not a high budget camera. but it's best for everyone looking for a Pocket friendly dslr. specifically for college students and for domestic use.
21461,5,I was planning to buy Dslr for long time. it's really good camera for beginners level photography and of course if any one have ability to shoot good quality photos may take easily with it. Delivery is very fast. Thanks flipkart for providing low cost pocket friendly opportunity on big billion day sale offer.
21462,5,Its a wonderful camera for the beginners. Those who have passion in photography and love to shoot its a good choice for them. Trust Canon !
21463,5,AWESOME DSLR AT THIS PRICE. I HAD A DREAM TO BUY A DSLR .THE MOMENT I BOUGHT THIS DSLR MY DREAM HAS TOTALLY FULLFIL. WAIT LISTENüôè. TO BE HONEST IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT TO START YOUR OWN BLOG OR ANY KIND OF YOUTUBE CONTENT THEN PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS. IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BUY DSLR FOR PHOTOSHOT THEN JUST GO FOR IT. AT ANY POINT OF TIME IF YOU THINK THAT YOU NEED MORE QUALITY IN PHOTOS YOU CAN EASILY ADD LENS‚ù§Ô∏è. THANK YOU.
21464,5,"Worth Buying ... Superb !! Loved it !! Bulit quality is lil disappointed if we are careful it's ok,overall can fully satisfy in dis price ..."
21465,5,"-Trusted seller with genuine product as shown in the image,from these seller one plus point is you can buy a cheapest dslr online in offer time. -Nice product in this price segment I bought this camera in big billion sale at cheap price,I am sharing some pictures capture with 3000D with 18-55 kit lense. -Its good for biginners. -Easy to use camera. - Switch to any mode it's 'ON' and for switch 'Off' there is a mode on same dial."
21466,4,The product is very good But if I take another lens of 55-250mm lens Then it's amazing so take it for photography And it's best for beginners
21467,5,Well Reviewing this after using for almost one month. I would prefer for the beginner photography. Simple without any complexity. It's best if you learn to use it at Manual mode
21468,4,Best in price segment. If you have skill this entry level dslr can do much better result. Just Dont expect much.
21469,3,Excellent piece of product for simple usage and can take nice shots of closer locations. Zoom option is not up to the mark and works like any other DC. Faced difficulties capturing a still image of moving objects.
21470,5,"Just bought it on the offer period for 16800, the product is well worth for the price I believe... this is my first dslr so I think I may be exaggerating , but its a good buy. Visually, the build quality has a premium quality , the quality of the images are good, rich and vibrant, although there is considerable amount of noise in them especially in artificial lighting conditions, buy a prime lens if you want the best quality photos from this one... the buttons are tactile but the screen is be..."
21471,5,Good one Best for beginner photographs Not recommend for videography because it is not good for videography or vloging porpes it is heavy and bulky. So if you're priority is photography it's a nice and value for money product.
21472,5,"it's a good DSLR to own if u are not a pro and looking for entry level DSLR. This camera comes with 16GB card, and 18-55 lense kit. Then buy separate Fixed Focus Lense for close-ups. This will b a perfect Device then. wifi connection allows u to connect it directly to ur PC or Mobile. Easy to use user interface. strong and sturdy body. battery backup is good."
21473,4,Excellent for someone who is new into photography..it gives you flexibility to try out a lots of manual settings just like any expensive dslr..even with kit lens you can click wonderful pictures...Clarity is not that great...For better clarity go for an expensive dslr
21474,5,"Guys please check the charger and battery when you receive the product. Fortunately my charger is not working fine, I gave it(charger) at canon service center for replacement. if the battery is not working we need pay the money from our pocket and that too we haven't check within ten days...  please use as early as possible one received the product....  One more important thing for any replacement is also take more time..."
21475,5,All over great camera nice quality of pictures i took and auto focus mode is work just awesome
21476,5,"Superb product at great price! The class of image which a true blue DSLR can give you is unmatched by even a top end mobile camera. This model is so good, gives the full feel of a heavy duty DSLR while being light on the pocket. The complimentary memory card and camera bag were a welcome bonus, the bag is of good quality. When you hold a Canon camera, you have the assurance and confidence of a top notch product."
21477,5,Nyc osm fantastic Fabulous pictures quality ls vary vary good in this price range I m gone for 5 star thank you flipkart thank you so much for this camera
21478,5,Great product. worth of price.. Thanks flipkart for delivering it in 3 days.. I love it... My first DSLR
21479,5,"I purchased this last in the month of October after using roughly almost 7-8 months I can say this camera is a gem for beginners and for pro guys you'll not dissatisfied with the quality of camera , image capture quality. good battery backup high quality lense high quality cables even carry case is also good yeah bag looks little old fashioned but who cares about the bag when you have very decent camera at this price range"
21480,4,The product is awesome for a beginner in the photography world it's preety good in this price range I have been using it since 1 week and I personally recommend to go with it by closing your eyes.
21481,5,By my side nice dslr in short range facilities and perfection is very gud. this is not for professional camera bt its img quality like pro.. tnx
21482,5,very good camera.....but not flash not support to this camera... mean that hot shoe is different from common hot shoe.....
21483,5,"Best camera ever. It's my first DSlr, never a disappointed. If you beginner that's have you. Go for it And just click result is awesome. Love you flipkart and love you very much nikon‚ù§Ô∏è"
21484,4,this is the best DSLR for beginer the price is the best DSLR best for the beginer I am really happy for this camera
21485,3,if you want a good video recording and good full HD pictures so you have to try some other DSLR otherwise it is good for simple use.
21486,4,amazing camera @ such price Range Display pixel is low but clearity in images we seen in mob laptops etc _ Best Camera Recommended for New users Better than my Nikkon D3400
21487,4,this camer is the perfect one in this because range for photography although it has okay kind video feature but beyon that its perfect for a beginners...it can shoot in raw...which i qs not expecting n evething is so simple to understand in this...im perfectly statisfied with camera .?
21488,4,"I purchased this as my first DSLR. Still, I am learning. Mostly I am using auto mode only, and use manual mode occasionally. I got very good photos of my car to be posted on CarSangrah. It helped me getting good response."
21489,5,"Terrific purchase.. I would like say before judging this product on the basis of looks and picture posted by others for this product won't give much exposure. For whom just want to buy a dslr I would say better get some knowledge about DSLR first how to operate it like what is aperture, focal length and shutter speed. Once you have this knowledge you can do anything and everything about photography with this product."
21490,5,I thin it was awesome.... I liked very much...... I am a beginner..... I really like my camera EOS 3000D..... NICE Pic clarity...... Lite wait..... Simple functioning..... I like very much.....
21491,5,awsome product and super fast delivery by ekart and the packing of the product was also good...thanks flipkart for ur super fast service
21492,5,A full featured DSLR with a good quality image sensor. It has all the features that are required for a mid level amateur. In skilled hands it is an awesome tool.
21493,5,"Very good camera, the blurr effect works properly here. A good one for new photographers. The camera is having ES mode also."
21494,5,its the best DSLR in the price range of below 20k .its a basic model..so don't expect more..but yes its far better than point to zoom cams......doesn't have good zoo.... could have been better...I purchased for 18990/- on big billion day sale...till now I m in learning mode...I m just exploring all the options
21495,5,thanks ekart to deliver 1 day before . thanks to flipkart to shipped at time . And deliver good product no any issue . when open cannon . picture quality is good . this is for new comer on photography . Image quality is good .
21496,5,Best DSLR in this price range and if you are a beginner then you should buy it . And this is canon. Entry level camera in this price range i bought at 20k and know current price is 27k around i am happy to grap under 21k . Its just amazing just buy it you will not regret. Microshot is working perfectly.
21497,3,product is good nice product in best budget battery backup is not good i didnt like the batery i m going to change the battery it offs suddenly even in a full charge
21498,5,what to say. just the best cam for amature photography enthusiasts. I mostly use it as point and shoot during family functions and spl occasions. works superb. it's pretty fast in taking pics in auto mode and offers all the basic modes as in most cameras but with exceptional picture clarity. just go for it if you are looking for cheap camera and professional quality photos. there is hardly any other camera in the market that offers the same value for money.
21499,5,"thks for fk for gud deal offer. thks to seller for timely despatch and safe packing. it's a gud deal for this money, gud for beginners. I gifted it for my dad."
21500,4,Camera is very good to take pictures and easy to handle. I am facing only problem of focus. If rotate the zoom to take close photo then it is not clear. May be i am not aware to set properly zoom. Otherwise in open area this is very good. Even can take photos of hills and from long distance.
21501,5,Nice decent camera. worth every penny. got it for 19k during but billon day. lightweight. WiFi enabled: camera connect app Iain Google pay should be installed to use also can use mobile as remote for taking pictures when connected through WiFi.
21502,4,Since this is my first DSLR so I give it 4 stars (after using it for a day) as I don't have anything to compare it with. But this has got all the features that a begginer can think of. Though an Auto Flash and a Metal Lens Mount (metal being more durable) could have added the fifth star to my rating. Picture quality is good considering 18 MP camera you can't expect more. Upgrade the lens if you want to have a better experience. I am not much worried about the video quality as I bought this fo...
21503,5,"Amazing camera for beginners. It really allows you to learn basics of photography like shutter speed, iso, aperture etc. I recommend every beginner to first learn how to use this one thoroughly and then move on to professional level cameras like 80D or 5D."
21504,4,Entry level DSLR. If the usage is only for family and trips then its for you. worth the price. capturing photos when screen is on is lagging but works perfect when shot with view finder. Build quality is good
21505,4,nice but little old lens. good for entry level. if you got extra bucks go for a better model.
21506,5,camera is good but if u are new to use it I would recommend that go for device having LCD screen it will be easy to use. other wise product is good at this price.
21507,4,it's awesome gift... always thnkful papa..I feel very happy .. it's good working...and very clean photo..
21508,4,Good one for a beginner.. Functionality is really good and worth the price. Loving it actually! but there should have been a cap for the display. That would make it perfect.
21509,5,Very Good Result But Not For Photographer in Studio Use . Studio Light Triger Nit Supported But Family Use Best Camera Under 25 k
21510,5,"Wow what an excellent product i'm so lucky to bought this camera is very less price and its working superbly, i recommend to all who want to try DSLR in beginning level, this camera giving you all what you want at initial level.. Thank you flipkart and Canon"

21520,4,"Guys, I have been using this DSL for almost 2 months, Image quality is very good in good lighting conditions, much better than our mobile phone cameras and indoor performance also good with flash but you can't use it without flash in low lighting condition.  Pros - Decent image quality for this price range. Decent battery life to take 600 photos in single charger. Wi-Fi function with canon app to download photos to smartphone easily.  Cons Fully Auto mode could have been better. On/off ..."

21786,5,nice DSLR
21787,4,good products
21788,5,Superb camera.
21789,1,There is a problem in auto zoom. It takes a lot of time in stabilizing the focus. I tried a lot to return and sorder a higher version ..but Flipkart policy has changed and this is creating a problem for us.  I request Flipkart to consider return also...not just replacement.. because we put a lot of money in products and if that comes out to be bad...then we are stuck. I'll make sure not to order anything . Would prefer buying it after testing in the market .. paying a bit more .. Atleast 500...
21790,5,best for beginers ill just say its osm
21791,5,super... my first DSLR.... it's my birthday gift from my wife....

21806,3,Pixel quality bad when image zooming
21807,4,"Two reasons for not rating 5 stars. One, I would have paid a bit more for a memory card too. Please include it, it's not complete without one. Two is more a camera display issue- it tends to randomly become quite white. I just passed my return by date, so I can't return, but it's a random issue. I've seen that reinserting the battery solves it."

21814,5,"everything reached in a perfect shape without any damage , cam is too good , but should be bought only with the zoom lens, kit lens is not that much useful.features are awesome. it is wifi enabled to share your photos. thorugh wifi u can connect ur mobile ,which can show the live cam screen on your mobile . flash is good i got it at 21500 without zoom lens. upto now there r no reasons to mark it a bad one ,except the reasons to say it is an awesome product at such a price."

They said there is 30x optical zoom whereas it only zoom upto 3x with 18-55mm lens, so it is my humble request to FLIPKART sales team to review the description once on their end before putting it on website."

22375,4,"Very good quality product with non stm lens. Quite fast autofocus but the focus motor makes considerable noise during videography.Plastic lens mount makes it a bit less durable. There's no separate power button and viewfinder diopter , it's of a bit problem. Nevertheless , it's the most affordable dslr in the market , and it can compete with any entry level dslr. Thus it's the best pick for a beginner."

22438,2,"Using it for quite some time. Fellow buyers, please don't get too much impressed with all these positive reviews. Even if price drops to 20000 during sale, its not worth it. Image quality is just like a smartphone. LCD screen has very very few pixels, so you can't use it in live view mode and also can't actually analyse picture you have just clicked. Autofocus is generally slow in live view mode in most of dslr but in this camera, it is very very slow. Image has too much noise in indoor shot..."

22440,1,Worst camera.  Not good at all.  Money waste only.

22501,3,The build quality is ok .....plastic but looks good . For a entry level camera its best in this price range . But you want a serious photography career then nikon is best .....the natural colour is better in nikon. It has one issue sometimes you can't able to take picture with flash mode on in Auto mode.....still I m struggling to solve this .....its a bad experience with this dslr. But picture quality is good for a entry level dslr.
22502,5,Value for money! I loved it ???

22512,4,"It's a great entry level dslr. If you are new into the photography or video making then you may go for this product. But i would suggest you to buy Canon 1500D, if you can. After you will be used to this product then you will feel like you have to upgrade but you may not be able to buy the new one. So, go for Canon 1500D if you are buying this, if you can't afford that, then you may go for this one. At last you are the user, you must know what to buy, Do some research on what you really need."

I don't feel to remove the lens out of my camera because the lens is that good. Buy additional memory card and a battery (LP-E10) for professional use. Simple and easy to navigate. Good beginner's camera ‚ò∫Ô∏è you can get best photos with it. Highly recommended!"

23266,5,"I'm not good photographer, so with my limited knowledge and usage, I'd say camera is more than value for money. Yes, pics quality is good, in both day & night (using flash). A lens and a camera kit bag which comes as supplement is an added benefit to carry & handle the camera safer during outing. Needless to say flipkart's service as it was delivered as promised!!!! Overall, considering it's price,this camera basic DSLR model, will be useful for the beginners."

24449,4,First of all this porduct is really good if your're new to photography and you dont need a high end camera unless you wanna make your career into it. Better spend on lenses. This camera is very good. But this review is considering the price in which I get. I got it for around 16.5k and that's hell of a deal. But usb cable for camera was missing from the package. Though the package was seal packed. If you get it for similar price range go ahead and buy.

24680,5,Just Awesome. Thanku Flipkart for quick delivery.
24681,5,"This is my first dslr so I was a bit skeptical about this one. But, Once I got that one believe me the first impression was marvelous. Light weight, well equipped with functionalities, and moreover the focus is pretty impressive. Only con I feel is the absence of auto flash, but that can be ignored as the pricing is pretty aggressive and it gives better performance than it's counterpart frok nikon. And thanks to Flipkart, the delivery was before time and spot on."

24747,5,"Best Mid range camera for photography lovers. I am writing the review after 3 months of using this cam , this is my 1st DSLR canon is a user friendly cam, it is basically good for videography. Nikon is quite hard to use,. it is best for photos if you want to upgrade your photography Tallents , and you are looking for a mid range cam ,. 100% go for it., lenses are good, 70-300 mm lens is mind-blowing output. so, go for dual lenses"
24748,5,If you confused between nikon d5600 and canon 200d then go with nikon d5600 without thinking again. It is very good camera with excellent features. The camera features 39 autofocus point helps us to focus faster and produces clear image. I share some images of the camera sample hope you like it.
24749,5,"Excellent camera for beginner photographers and also a best back up for pro also. Amazing colour depth, fast focusing, crystal clear photo. Lightweight is a advantage while you are travelling. Vary angle screen is very useful when taking ground level shots or over the crowd shots and very helpful for blogging purpuse also. You can attach external mic. Battery life is very good. Through WiFi and snapbridge downloading photos in smartphone from camera is too easy. It supports Bluetooth also. I..."
24750,5,"Awesome product. If you are looking for semi-pro DSLR you can buy this without it thinking. Easy handling, easy handy features"
24751,5,"I think this the best entry level dslr in this range. I got a 18-55mm kit lense, 16gb memory card and lowepro bag. Bag quality is good. This model is good because you are getting a touch screen enabled dslr in the price range where most of other brands giving non touch screen models. Some features like very easy to operate, touch screen, fast auto focus and sharp images make this dslr a best entry level dslr. I am attaching some pictures clicked with this dslr(flipkart not letting me add more..."
24752,5,"You can't have a better mid-range DSLR. However I don't like 18mm-55mm lens, but you'll get sharp and crisp photos with 70mm-300mm lens. The camera is feature loaded and very light. You'll love it."
24753,5,"Wow, love the Camera....I have already used Nikon d 3500 in my Laboratory but this camera is far better. Flipkart delivered at time and the product was at best conditions. This is my first personal DSLR, so guys after using for 2 weeks, I must say that go for it, there is no other camera which could provide same level as Nikon d 5600. Colour tone production, lots of effect, smooth touch screen, good battery life, etc. Just go for it."
24754,5,No doubt Nikon's lineup for intermediate DSLR are catchworthy . but one must also invest in additional lenses to get the most out of d5600 . like in my case I ordered 35mm 1.8g lens when paired with d5600 produced great results . not going over the specifications. camera is just awesome produces detailed and sharp images .  70-300 lens do have its own advantages .but after 250mm its just doesn't perform up to the mark.but hey! you get this in that price bracket which is fine to me .  guid...
24755,5,"My First DSLR and the best decision that I made. The KIT lenses are not so ideal for lowlight photography but you can always get the best out of it. Overall very satisfied with the quality of photos, camera body and lens to start the learning process."

24758,4,Good semi professional dslr from Nikon. Packing is good and the product is really nice. Not recommended for professional photographers and good for a beginner. It's features are best in class and have a good quality material in real. It's touch function is lit. Rotating screen helps in taking photos or record videos in selfie mode or in certain positions. The bag which is packed with the camera will only have the space to adjust lesser items. For a professional photographer it is recommended ...
24759,5,Very Fast Delivery by Flipkart nd Service! I like it! Nikon D5600 Is Super Camera In this Price Range! I Really Happy With My New Nikon D5600 DSLR! It's Amazing Cemera!

24760,5,Best DSLR for beginners..don't think too much just click buy now..!I purchased on bbday with a great deal but i bought single lens. So i suggest please if you want more depth or wildlife photography then go for 70-300 mm also. Even though it can deliver good photos with this 18-55 mm lens. Thanks to Flipkart for the great package and delivery. Happy click..!
24761,4,Reviewing after using for an year. This is my first dslr and It gives stunning images. The 70-300 lens is simply awesome and thats the one I use the most. Autofocus while taking video is really bad. It cant focus well on moving objects. Even for slowly moving subjects it doesn't focus well. I think Canon200d is good if you prefer videography as it has much faster autofocus although the price is much higher than Nikon D5600 .But if your preference is only photography then go for it as it is a...
24762,5,"Cant say anything about the DSLR right now cause I am learning how to shoot but flipkart delivered it in a safe packaging and on time..  Edited on 16 Jan 2020 So, now I am using this for last 6 months and I want to say best in this price. I am not highlighting the features which all dslr have. but the best features which you will get in this price which none other dslr can give you today are 1. Articulated Touch screen. 2. Wifi transfer. 3. 39 AF point  Just go for it. Its a big plus. check o..."
24763,4,The camera is excellent. Probably the best one in this price range. Completely happy with the camera.  Would like to mention that the bag I received is a good quality Nikon original bag.  Giving 4 stars because it took 14 days to get the product delivered despite of having a Flipkart plus membership.
24764,5,"This is one step above the Entry level ( Nikon D3*** series). Pro - Light weight , Easy to handle , wifi , articulated screen . Image Quality is good . Low light performance is good . Better than expected. Snapbridge for your easy file tranfer Can shoot Raw + Jpeg Best in Mid level DSLR I had got a ridiculous deal with 18-55 and 70-300 deal. Thanks to Flipkart.  Cons - insufficient grip . Those who are new to DSLR won't find this . But the ones who are trying to upgrade this will disappoi..."
24765,5,"It was delivered in good condition. When it comes to camera, it is really good and easy to use. Good choice for a beginner."
24766,4,Awesome product but came with worst packaging. The seal of the packaging box was open. Flipkart should show some effort in packing camera like they do in mobiles. About the camera I would say that it's one of the best dslr in its class. But flipkart providing only 8gb card instead of 16gb. Rest the product is all good. Happy imaging.
24767,5,iam surprised. great dslr at this price range.. better to handle.. user friendly cam.. low light picsüí• .. really loved it !!
24768,5,"Great APSC DX camera which stand besides the Big brother D7100 & D7200. Instead of thease it have a Articulated Screen with Touch function, its a great option for those looking Midranged entry leval DSLR. U can also check D5500 & D5300. overall its a great deal. If u dont mind about your pocket then u can choose D7100 or D7200."
24769,5,pros : Beginner level camera bast for YouTube purpose focusing is fast in photo only build quality is amazing effects extra feature is best for quick retouching zooming and Focusing very perfect inbuilt mic plus sound battery backup amazing  cons : Difficult to learn User interface Bag quality is worst low performance in videography only 16Gb memory card provided  overall best
24770,5,It's amazing . I liked it. I order it in 15.2.20 and it came in 18.2.20 fast delivery. And the photos are also good.
24771,5,Great camera for all beginners. I have been using it for an year. Great specs with this price. If you just a photography enthusiast then u should go for it.
24772,4,every thing works fine except for auto focus excellent for photos terrible for videos one thing this camera can improve on is autofocus love the manual flash option for in built flash
24773,5,Great quality ... It's not a beginner camera ... It's a middle professional camera ... Good image quality ... I loved it
24774,4,awesome product for great value 36k I got this product at 36k which was awesome.and its genuine product criss checked with nikon site.go for it guys
24775,5,Worth for money. Packing was good and everything claimed by Flipkart was there in the box. Nikon D5600 is really a DSLR camera with a lot of functions and an excellent quality of pics.
24776,4,"Camera is pretty darn good as mentioned by other people. Bag was just pure awfulness, wore out in a few days."
24777,5,"The best DSLR for beginners, if your budget is around 50k then you should definitely go for it awesome camera in great price range. Here are some unedited clicks."
24778,5,one of the best DSLR for beginners.. I upgraded from D3200 to D5600.. I'm loving it üòä
24779,5,"Great camera for beginners and go for it if you are one. If you have a heavy pocket, my suggestion is to go for a full-frame(sensor) camera instead of this. This one is great, but eventually you'll need to upgrade to full-frame as you evolve and no longer be a beginner in photography.  Overall it's a good package with a wide range of lens compatibility, not only from Nikon but from other manufacturers as well."
24780,5,it is a good camera in a reasonable price.it is easy to handle and has descend battery back up.it was delivered safely.
24781,5,"After too much of research i decided to buy d5600 with 18-140mm lens. Any beginner planning to buy DSLR, this is the right choice. It's my first DSLR & I'm really happy with the service & product. Thank you flipkart for delivering it the very next day. Awesome packaging & lower pro bag is pretty good."
24782,5,I am writing the review after one week of usage...  The product is just awesome! Performs very well in both indoor and outdoor photography. Low light performance is also upto the mark. Love this product. Unbeatable in this price range. 70-300 mm lens is adding more flavour to it‚ô•Ô∏è. Video recording is a bit concern. But never regret after buying it
24783,5,My first DSLR. Nice and genuine camera sent by Flipkart. But was delivered after many followups and two weeks after the order. Got it for 34K (with one lens) on big billion day sale. Nice deal I guess.!! About picture quality and camera quality I will write soon.
24784,5,Writing review after usage. very good camera and clarity also good. 70 to 300 lens is very good. Best camera at this price for beginners. I am also beginner and added my photos
24785,5,"This is going to be quite funny.  I owned a Nikon D5200 and it pretty much served me well. I bought it for 16k from overkart (refurb) and it didn't have any complaints at all. Recently, I've been more into photography and thought of upgrading my d5200.  I didn't need a pro SLR as I ain't a full time photographer. But wanted a compact yet capable camera. I filtered out the suitable options and finally made into two ; Nikon D5600 and Canon 77d.  Now here begins the fun part. How to choose o..."
24786,5,"Great Camera !!! Took Some Time To understand all the basics of photography... its giving good quality pictures.

24787,5,I've been using it since couple of days and it just impressed me. I am a beginner in photography yet this camera helped me capture some stunning shots.
24788,5,Excellent buy. Camera with 18-140mm lens is quite compact for DSLR standards. Nikon interface is easy to use for the first time Nikon buyers. Touch has right sensitivity and response . that really helps to focus the object with a touch of the finger rather than fiddling around with buttons. Images are quite sharp even on 140mm range.  Flipkart delivery was a let down. delivery executive just handed over the package to security gate without informing me. And the package was crushed outside. L...
24789,4,"First of all, excellent delivery and packing by flipkart. amazing camera. very compact and small in size. easy to handle. stand kit lens 18-55 is good and af speed is super fast and super quiet.  only drawback - snapbridge is really bad !!"
24790,5,"5 on 5 stars Excellent camera with awesome and crisp quality Easy to use for beginners with simple settings.. love this camera and the lens 18-140mm Bought it for 53,000/-"
24791,5,Nic camera. And Good and great quality of images and. Auto focus is excellent. Pixel density is Assom and mind blowing. Best dslr for mid level and professional photographer
24792,5,I have uploaded unboxing video on my YouTube channel ''Kushagra Porwal '' and firstly I have decided to buy Nikon D5300 instead of D5600 but only screen difference is there in both the cameras that D5300 has not a touch screen and D5600 has a touch screen and Nikon D5600 has a great video quality and has more functions Very good camera just go for it without any confusion and photo and video quality is also awesome. The camera has a flip screen which helps you to take selfies and is also goo...
24793,5,so overall experience was good but flipkart has to work on their problems regarding packaging. As a assured customer of a flipkart we believe in you while purchasing costly products so you should do packing well not only for your satisfaction but for customer satisfaction. when we saw product packing we felt a sheer disappointment..but we are giving 3/5 for early delivery of product only. so pleased work on it..
24794,5,Awesome purchase. Auto focussing and different effects are really positive of this product. Very impressive and easy to carry and handling.
24795,5,"Excellent entry level dslr for someone who wants to upgrade from mobile photography. 2016 model but Nikon has not released any other camera in this range. Well packed. Received in good condition. 18-55 mm and 70-300 mm kit lenses are okay for beginners. However, to get pro like pics, one needs to learn some editing (all pro photographers shoots in RAW format and edit their pics) . The provided Nikon bag is okay to start with along with the two kit lenses. Image quality is superb. You can buy ..."
24796,5,Bought the camera as my first SLR camera being a enthusiatic amature photographer. The main reason to go for this over the D3500 is the rotating touch display which helps more than you think. The photography related aspects of the camera is identical to the D3500 but the features are more and AF points are also a bit more. In the world of fast growing mirrorless cameras the D5600 is truly still a great option for any entry level photographer. Most pohotographer do not need a full frame camera...
24797,5,"Awesome choice for beginners. It is my first DSLR and I like it so much. Flipkart delivered it within the promised time. Wanted to tell about the bag, I received NIKON original bag."

24803,5,One of the best product in this price range. Picture quality is awesome. 0ackaging was good too and the delivery was at my doorstep. Thank you.
24804,5,"The product works exactly as promised. It is a very convenient dslr with built in intervalometer and a flip out display which makes the photo making process hassle free and more such features are worth paying a little extra than getting a D3500 or related segment camera.  Only DRAWBACK is that the battery life is low and the battery charger doesn't carry a warranty. My charger took its last breath right after one month of purchase, so I had to go for a 3rd party charger.  But overall I'd s..."

And also I wants to thank flipkart for the free gift of Samsung Bluetooth headfone.. And have got the Bluetooth headset with the nikon d5600....now just wants to click and enjoy my photography with the camera....
24810,5,Just loving it every time I use it. It's handy and very convenient to handle.Images are mind blowing but you really need to use it manually for better results than auto mode. Flipkart took hardly a day to deliver it and the packing was good. Go for it without a second thought!
24811,5,"Writing a review after nearly one year. Working perfectly till date, no problems. Received it with company seal. Thanks Flipkart for making it available on EMI and that too on debit card of SBI. Kudos Flipkart. Keep up the good work."
24812,5,"Camera is excellent. Just not satisfied with 18-55 mm lens, because i expect lens with automatic-manual switch. But this only manual lens. overall good product. and we get good quality images in 70-300 mm lens. great."

It''s an awesome camera according to budget and it's an entry level camera so in low light , higher iso you wil..."
24816,4,"Great delivery and great product. Although the packaging was missing the sd card, but flipkart was quick to address it and provide me a gift card for the value of that card. Much appreciated work by flipkart team.  About the camera, it is an awesome device. I tried clicking some pictures in the lockdown and I got some really great result.  More details to come after some usage"
24817,5,"One of the best cameras out there for beginners!!..It can be described a bridge between a beginner and a pro camera!!....it is just fab,the articulating screen is helpful so is the touchscreen,i am in complete love with this camera note-Only buy this camera iff you want to be a photographer,dont buy if you are into videography!"
24818,5,First of all thanks for Flipkart for delivering in two days. Camera is simply awesome and cute in size Light weight Beautiful architecture of camera structure so pleasant in hands never felt bulky Camera bag is provided as complimentary which is a good thing Battery backup is good too I am a beginner so I can't give technical review But I have heard from so many people this is a best camera to become a pro and even I felt the same Touch screen is awesome
24819,5,best camera for beginners.. pretty easy to handle.. and great quality. for this price range this is the best. don't hesitate buying it.
24820,5,"good graphic ,has good clarity for taking photos and doing video recording best camera"

24822,5,I am very happy with flipkart as my wish came true due to big billion days. This DSLR is quite very good in performance and easy to handle. A starter can take very good photos with the given kit lens.
24823,5,"It's a awesome product, like dreams come true for me. very user-friendly features, handy. Comes with 16gb memory card, battery, adapter, dual lens, strap, bag & cam body. And the thing I must appreciate that, the fast delivery periode of Flipkart. thanks to flipkart and Nikon."
24824,5,This is a very good camera to begin with but it's not just a beginner's camera it has some high end features as well. Easy to operate. Enjoying my use.
24825,5,Camera is Very good and flip kart facility is also very good but camera bag is not satisfied me.... All things in this camera package is good this packaging is very good by flipkart.....
24826,4,nice work and fast and their is many configurations and the best one in this price range but Nikon hv to improve it's manual copy which is just inside the retail box
24827,5,I simply love it. great autofocus awesome outputs. It rocks my videos. you can watch quality on my youtube channel which is Tech Geeks
24828,5,The camera is wonderful both lens are fine .The packing was also good the picture quality is fine. One should go for it.

24832,5,Really a awesome dslr to go for. RAW images captured in this camera is very good and post processing results of images are also very good. As a photographer i‚Äôll recommend this camera for beginners. Buy a prime lens separately with this camera and thats it. U are good to go.üëç
24833,4,I am not an expert in photography but I am happy with quality of images in auto mode. I am trying to learn other skills of photography and fortunately I found its the right product I have purchased for both beginners and for expert's.
24834,5,"Well my review is supposed to be rated 4.5 rather than a 5, if I wrote this review without using the camera first. This camera is a great piece for people who are on a advanced beginner to a mid experience level. It offers all the functionalities that you would demand from a good DSLR and then it adds some tweaks here and there to spice up the experience for you.  What I was angry about was that the camera came with the AF-P lenses than AF-S lenses. Something I absolutely didn't see while ord..."
24835,5,If you want a super awesome dslr go for it. It has all the pro features you will ever need as a amateur photographer. Also go for a 50 mm lens if u want to shoot better bookeh effect
24836,5,Just grab it....!! You will not get disappointed... Being an enthusiast i am. Telling as photography is passion for me..butmy budget was not that great. So i bought this one with the dual kit lens (18-55mm and 70-300mm) lens.

Along with that extension tube and reverse ring for macro. And a...
24837,5,Amazing experience of this dslr camera . Great clarity in photos . Five stars from my side. SnapBridge app make available photos transfer to the phone directly
24838,4,Nice DSLR. Bag provided is Lowepro NOT Nikon. But lowepro bag is of very good quality. There are two lenses. Nikon in their India website says the following : E-COMMERCE WEBSITES/PORTALS ARE NOT OUR AUTHORIZED PARTNERS/ DEALERS IN INDIA FOR SALE OF NIKON PRODUCTS OR ACCESSORIES. We advise you to check the warranty entitlements of the products sold through e-commerce websites/ portals under the brand name ‚ÄòNikon‚Äô. But this was posted in their site on 09-09-2015. Who knows what changed after that.

25044,4,first shoot
25045,4,Got it at 38999 rs in big billion days. Nice camera. two kit lens and camera body.awesome.
25046,5,nice
25047,5,"But it guys, and get a 50mm prime lens. I've got a girlfriend now because of this dslr. Thanks Nikon for filling up this void in my life. Touch screen really makes life easy."
25048,5,excellent..
25049,5,"Got it for around 38k during bbd with two lens.overall build quality is very good,happy to have it over canon 77d ,which is bit costly then this and it give almost similar image quality as 77d."
25050,5,No Words can describe how happy I am for receiving this camera on time. Flipkart took the utmost care for it's customers and left no store unturned for any of the services it provided. The Camera is as per description and I'm still getting to know it so will post a further review soon.
25051,4,good
25052,5,nice product...
25053,5,osm gift of my life. nikon d5600 is amazingly
25054,5,This is my first investment for study... This product Nikon D5600 with 15 to 55 mm kit lens is really great and best for me as a beginner in photography... This product is totally fine.. No defects founded by me in this... Over all hats off Nikon
25055,5,fabulous deal
25056,2,camera bag is not original
25057,3,"Everything in the camera is good, but if you buy this from store, a Samsung bluetooth headset worth Rs 3000 is complementary with any DSLR camera, but if you buy from here seller doesn't send the bluetooth headset. This is the cheating as nikon himself is giving complementary headset, then what is the problem with seller for sending the same. Camera is fantastic and both the lenses are working superb. Thanks"
25058,5,NICEEEE CAMERA
25059,5,"In the Entry level DSLR category, this is the best option. D5600 is compared to 200D, but in real word 5600 fairs much better in all areas. Go for it!!"
25060,5,Garda product
25061,3,camera is fine but the free Samsung Bluetooth headphone was not provided
25062,5,"Everything is ok, but I got a camera backpack instead I wanted a sling bag to carry my camera. Now this sometimes make me uneasy to carry both laptop and camera together. So if you are looking for a backpack with the camera then no doubt, go for it but if you want a sling bag then, i think you should confirm it first from their services. Happy Clicking!"
25063,2,BATTERY SUPPLIED WITH CAMERA IS NOT OK. DISCHARGED WITH IN DAY WHILE TAKING ONLY AROUND 50-60 CLIKS.  NOT SATISFIED
25064,5,"Flipkart has given surprised bag with camera. 5600 - No review/comments required, it's more than expected."

25250,4,Its been two days since I started using the camera. First thing to say is that I didn't get bag along with the product. They could have provided a bag as its a costly dslr. Some people said they got a headphone along with the product. I don't have any complaint about not getting the headphone. But carry bag is an essential accessory. 4 star only for this reason. Otherwise no complaints. It's a good product as we know.

Got my delivery cancelled for the day twice after getting a text 'Out for delivery', just because two delivery executives had developed some confusion between them about the responsibility of delivery of my shipment. At last, I had to travel 50km up down to pick it up myself from a flipkart facility. Hoping for more professionalism for my next delivery that is scheduled for tomorrow."
25421,5,Awesome product
25422,5,Excellent product
25423,4,In comparison to canon 200dii....nikon d5600 is the best in photography than 200dii. but in video department 200dii is the best. If your main priority is photography go for d5600 which have better auto focus points and colour depth

25826,5,"Awesome camera. Even the low light photos are great with the kit lens. I am wondering what wonder this will do with prime lens. And one very important thing, The lenses for Nikon are way costlier than the Canon's. e.g. 50mm stm lens for canon is priced at around 7500 INR but 50 mm nikkor 1.8 g lens is 12500 INR, so choose the camera wisely. And if that does not bother you, you can buy this for sure. You will never regret the decision."

25965,4,I am a new beginner into photography. after doing analysis of which camera will suits to learning. For that I purchased Nikon D5600 because I feel it has good features for entry level dslr as quality of image really good.  I haven't used it much but now I am investing my time to do proper camera settings before any photography session.  Worth buying all I can say.
25966,5,It's very nice
25967,5,Photos coming amazing.the dedicated modes definitely help take amazing photos.the touch screen is a big advantage while using it. the dslr to mobile transfer is very fast. using with 18-55 mm lens. Colors ar coming very sharp and bright.

26436,5,"Very nice printer, is worth the purchase. Ideal for Home printing but the black cartridge prints hardly 100 Pages and same with Color cartridge.The cartridge price is costly so I suggest you to Buy GoColor Canon compatible ink's each bottle is of 100 ML and you will find that there's is difference between Original and GoColor ink's. You can refill the cartridge at home in the kit you get everything just watch a video on YouTube and you will save you 96% Printing cost. I have done the same thi..."
26437,5,"great !! easy to use ,, budget friendly,, good printing quality,, looks comfortable, weight also user friendly"
26438,5,nice product I am a student I ordered this for my work I don't have a computer or a laptop I only have Android phones so I ordered that and now I print the worksheet from this printer very nice printer
26439,5,super Good delivery and canon printer is Good Quality.... value of money.. best product..
26440,1,After using 1 year I am writing  Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges  Believe me never think to purchase it  It's very less efficient for avg class people Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees  Print quality is not good as laser printer  After refilling not expect to see good results  It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less  So my suggestion to all those people who want...
26441,5,"Was delivered within 48 hours. Not bad I must say since I ordered it during the current festive season.  What I got with this very neat looking printer -  1. connecting cables 2. color + black ink cartridges 3. Driver cd  Unlike in the reviews mentioned earlier, the printing speed is quite good, scanning is excellent and it just looks so neat sitting in my office back home.  Ideal for home use. Good product. And the price was a steal.  Cheers to Flipkart :)"
26442,5,"I loved this oder . The delivery boy's behaviour was also good . Very good product, worth of money and i loved a feature that we can zerox,print and scan. In the last i want to say that very very very very good product.üëçüèªüëçüèªüëåüèªüëåüèªü•∞üòçüòò"
26443,4,For the price of 1999 its a good deal. The printing is very slow. The copy and scan function works fine (good speed). Ink cartridge as usual are costly and one time purchase will sum up-to the printers cost.   The black ink cartridge won't even last 40 papers. Its showing low ink now. I am pretty sure color cartridge will be the same.
26444,1,printer is very good but it's cartage is not good because it prints less than 100 copies and even after cartage is empty than new cartage cost is very high.. So I don't recommend this printer to anyone.
26445,5,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
26446,5,Very nice product . I am loving it . best printer at this price
26447,4,"Looks great but it was very delicate piece nd also careful with plugin points as they are sensitive, overall it is best for home printers. Doesn't have bluetooth or wifi connection only works through cable. Printed nicely and easy to print."
26448,5,"Timely delivery. Print quality is excellent. Easy to install. Got it at the best price. As usual, happy with my shopping experience"
26449,5,Best thing is abt the cartridges are very easily available and they can be refilled as well unlike most of the other printer.  Scanning Quality and speed is great as compared to others.
26450,3,The product you sent me had faulty scanner.the service centre was nearby so.i got it fixed .. this not a good thing. But i am a kind person so i will buy another one and give this seller another chance ..  Btw its a good printer like hp1050

26452,5,Amazing printer But cartridge is expansive But there is a way you can save your money by refilling your cartridge Just purchase ANG refill ink and fill cartridge You can see videos in youtube of cartridge refill By this way you can save your money upto 95 % Once again product is amazing Thanks flipkart for fast and safe delivery ‚ù§
26453,5,"PROS: 1. Available at cheap price. 2. Decent for less amount of printing. 3. Scanner is fast and colour accurate.  CONS: 1. Ink capacity is too low, hardly prints 40 pages with the cartridge included. 2. Print speed is too slow. 3. Cartridge are costly as compared to other printer.  Suggestion: Get a cartridge refill kit which has all essential tools required and good quality ink! Happy Printing :)"
26454,5,"Well agree to some of the reviews made that it is slow, however note that it happens only while using it for the first time.  After the color test page is printed, you will see that the printing speed is comparatively better.  Ink Cartridge are a bit expensive and even one of the ink gets finished you wont be able to use Printer, the best alternative would be ink colors that are available in flipkart.  Delivery was as usual best by Flipkart."
26455,4,Best printer with reliable price. Easy setup and installation. Works excellent with Linux OS as no need to supply CD and driver. Everything is done by linux itself.
26456,5,it is good and viry high compartiable product it can scan fast and it can print with a good print its good printer so many of them should by withs seller
26457,4,"Received the printer in good condition. It looks modern, and the shape and size is pleasing to the eye. It installed fairly easily. Found it convenient to use. Printout is of sufficiently good quality. Overall, a good product. The price of the printer is low, so I don't think that the printing costs are going to be very good."
26458,5,Before time delivery and well packed. Very good printer for domestic use.. Good quality printing and scanning. Recommended product from my side in the price range.
26459,2,Pros: 1. Decent Product for home use (only for printing and copying). Printing speed is average. Easy to troubleshoot  Cons: 1. Configuring scanner is a big head-ache. The driver given along with the product wont be compatible or have some issues with Win7(I tried with 2 laptops and a desktop). Communicated with Canon support to sort it out. But again stopped working in a months time 2. Makes lot of noise while printing.  Verdict: You can use this product only for printing and copying. I...
26460,4,"I am writing this review after 4 years of use. The printer worked fine for whole 4 years. Easy to scan and xerox. Print quality is good. Cartidge is costly. After using for 4.5 years, it is showing some software error. Canon Service Centre is asking for 2500/- (same as the printer price) to reset the processor IC of the printer. Hence I placed an order for a new one again from Flipkart."
26461,4,So far it's good . I got a little blinding edges but it's just minor details . The colour print quality is pretty amazing it's like the ones we get cafes . Yes buying the ink will be expensive . Printed some cartoons and I'm happy they look amazing.
26462,5,"Great product for an average user, it's perfect for office or school work and the best thing it's color cartridges ain't much costly either."
26463,4,good product at low price. good for home use specially for school project. delivery was done by GATI. could be more efficient. Flipkart just love you for your offers .
26464,3,Hey..! I've been using this canon pixma as my first printer for about 6 months..!  Pros : It is really cost efficient..my usual cartridge refill last about 2 months of basic home usage+projects 2. It is scanner + printer which both works fine. 3. Doesn't take much space and sheets Cons : Sometimes dont give efficient results.some smudges and print on paper Paper takes too much time to get recieved in printer Overall its a good product but only recomment it for home use.üéÄüéÄ
26465,2,This printer is good also it can be used to copy but this is not good for scanning. scanning option is seen anywhere. printing and coping is clear and good. good for homely use.
26466,5,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
26467,1,"Well despite the fact that its a good brand. The product is not worth buying. I bought it some 8 month back and believe me it has hardly given some good response and hardly got 30 copy printed. Such a Waste of money, instead get it xerox from store and get a good one."
26468,4,very good product and nice printing.. I am really very happy ....but ink cartridge ends very quickly and not used to others purpose.
26469,4,LOVE THIS PRINTER AT THAT PRICE PROS- GOOD DPI PRINTING AND SHARP PRINTING THAN OTHER PRINTERS AT SAME PRICE FAST PHOTO SCANNING DRIVERS ARE AVILABLE IN ONLINE ALSO CARTRIAGES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE IN STORE EASSY SETUP AND HANDDLING REFIILABLE CARTRIGES SOME EXTRA ADDITIONAL PRINTING FETURES ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS PRINTER'S APPLICATION 80% MAINTANNCE AND DIAGNOSTICS ARE COMPLITED BY THE APPLICATION AVAILABLE ACANING QUALITY AND PRINTING QUALITY SETTINGS(MANUALLY) BEST FOR HOME USE UNIVERSEL US...

26472,5,Awesome results in colored pictures..best printer for home use..it has also Xerox and scanner.. thank you Flipkart for quick delivery... thank you canon for make this printer in very less prices..

26475,5,Very nice product i am satisfied in this product Delivery on time thankyou flipkart for giving us a wonderful experience with this product. This product cost is 2799 but i got at 1999
26476,4,It's Amazing I like this one but the quality is good but it can be better with some improvements
26477,5,Very nice product awesome product for me print fine and scan very fine photo copy print good quality.....
26478,4,"Till now it work very fine ,cartrege ink consume very fast ,otherwise it is good product at this price ,"
26479,5,Printer is very good but ink finished off soon both black and colour The print pages doesn't exceed more than 50 also better to go for laser print
26480,5,Very good looking product and so clean printing of this printer I love it because the quality of this print is so nice......
26481,5,Well product and proper work well printing and smoth printin

26484,5,Very nice product in affordable price.delivery was good.packing was awesome .printer working very much fine .
26485,5,Superb very friendly for personal use very fast and good quality love it
26486,5,"Excellent product in seal pack . Lowest price for an all in one . Good quality printing , scanning . Easy to handle for personal use"
26487,5,"its a good printer, but i found it little slow to start printing. the scanner is really awesome which give good clarity"
26488,3,it's compact for colour .it's too use 650 copies colours.and throw it. just use like use and throw product . simplyfy if one colour copy is 5 rupees the how much for 650 copies it's very useful
26489,5,"It is doing fairly good job in printing, scanning and copying. It comes very handy at home for children projects and small printing and photocopying tasks. One important thing to note: - in specifications, flipkart has given NO duplex print option. But it has MANUAL DUPLEX PRINTING OPTION. Printer interface is guiding how to change paper for printing on second side of the paper. I took printout on both sides of paper through MS word and PDF files. I am much satisfied with its performance."
26490,3,printer is good but only give 100-150 black and White And 50-70 colour page in Starter Cartidge. And thr Photo Printing is Not Good... I recommend you to go for better printer. u can only use it if you are student.
26491,5,A very great printing is done by this awesome printer. Budget friendly as well as excellent performance is what I review.Must buy from Flipkart cuz of amazing price and fast delivery.
26492,4,Very good deal at 2k. Black cartridge cost 500 and colour 700. Do all work nicely. Do not support through otg or android mobile. No app supports its driver. Mg2500 driver on android apps does the work but thos apps are charging rs500.
26493,5,super nice and super cool
26494,2,"Product quality is good. But the Ink cartridge is small with the printer in two numbers (ie. Colour & black) Refill cartridge cost above Rs.800/-. Flipkart delivery boy insisted the ""home"" delivery in our area, we given the delivery address clearly at the time of booking with Pincode. After few argument, finally they delivered ""on the road"" nearer to the address given. I am not happy with the delivery, that is why 2 star rating given."
26495,2,"You'd better not to buy this. Yes, printer cost is comparatively low and print quality is also excellent. But what about the printing cost? Highly expensive. Ink cartridges (XL) cost is more than that of the printer itself. No other similar cartridges available in the market so that you have an option which one to buy. Better not to buy it, event if it is a cheap and good quality. We have to keep in mind- A printer is not a show-piece; it has to print day to day."
26496,5,"In this budget, it gives great service. I have bought it specially for scanning purpose. It gives good scanned images as well as scanned pdf documents. Its printing quality is also good."
26497,5,such a nice machine it's not like ricket science easy to install works well compact design BUT it takes 2-3 seconds to dry the ink
26498,2,Best t Best Buy on Flipkart nice to print absolutely fine
26499,4,This product is good and very nice. at normal price and getting good quality product anyone can buy this product black and white colour print nice
26500,5,Nice work printer is good Light wait with nice print
26501,3,This printer works only 2 months after refined ink not work in perfectly
26502,5,I'm a student and this printer is so helping me in project works and my many other works of schools. I like it .
26503,4,"good product, nice image printing, good zeros quality, I am Happy this product."
26504,4,"Not bad for price you pay, i was mainly looking for scanner and it does work so no complain. I struggled to do setup though, it took 1 day to figure out that it only works when you insert both cartridge, as my plan was to scan i didn't put color cartridge and that caused error 214021. Wish there could have been some better info on this... Printer is also good but ink drys too fast so don't expect much out of it."
26505,4,Good at 1999 rs only. Cartridge price is more. but you can install ciss system to get affordable prints and easy to refill.
26506,5,"I got this for office work, prints and photo prints at home. Its amazingly user friendly i installed this and use it with laptop. Best part is they hv given both ink cartridges with this. I had A4 size paper with me. Only prob is it doesn't connects with any mobiles as USB point is for laptop or pc. I had to watch YouTube videos though as manual is bakwaas n cd dekhne ka tym nahi hai. But really excellent print outs n fast."
26507,5,"Great multi function printer at a great discounted price. printed picture quality is awesome, but using more ink cartridge than my regular hp printer. buy overall it's a great deal for 1999/-"
26508,2,"it's not good Or not bad,,.. It's work too much slower.. but not bad... it's ink Is not working longer ... I'm not happy with this INK problem... Thanks to Flifkart...."

26522,4,I got this product on big billion day 2014 for Rs 0.....yes....zero :) Have been using this product since. Works fine till now. The product is shipped with two partially filled cartridges- color and black which is the best thing because once your cartridges are finished you need around 2000 rs to buy new pair of cartridges. Refilling is also an option and work up to around 10 times on black but clarity will be on the downside. The main disadvantage is the ink consumption. Each time printer...
26523,4,"It is my heartful review about the product. I bougth this product last month at a resonable price of Rs.2500 and after expering its performance for a month I'm writing this. This is a good product to buy on comparing the other printers at this price range as it supports print, scan n copy options it is very good n efficient one n the only lag is it doesnt have the wireless faccility, otherwise it will be the ultimate one.

26527,3,"Got a printer - All in one - for a steal!! Less than 3k is just good. That too, Canon. Performance is good but i am sure the ink is going to cost a lot. Hope it gives sufficient prints on a full cartridge. What i don't like about it is, it makes a lot of noise when fetching the paper in order to start printing. First i felt as if some part is broken. It was too loud. But then i realized, it is maybe because of the cost cutting that some things were compromised. Another issue is that it doesn'..."

26533,4,"Do you believe? About 80% of people are buying product based on the review and thats how these online shoppers gain trust..  Anyways, about this product its good and compact in design. It has few important features like coping, scanning etc. This product is worth to buy but the greatest drawback will lye on its cartridge. One black cartridge cost around Rs.800 and it can print only 150 pages so image the printer cost Rs.2400 but the single cartridge cost rs.800 now we can make out how we get ..."

26543,4,I just wanted to print documents once in a while. Not a heavy user so it is good for me. It is light weight print quality is also good. Works fine with macbook. Colour is also good and presentable on any desk. If you are a heavy user or need it for professional prints maybe go for higher end models. Wish it was wireless but cant complain much at the price.
26544,4,"This is a printer for normal use... The photocopy and the print quality are good and clear. It does all my works of printing, scanning and photocopy. The only thing that i didnt like is that it makes sounds while printing. However it is an inkjet printer, all inkjet printer does that. Best buy at such price"

Good product and I do not think one has to think twice for going for it. Delivered on time by Flipkart. Thanks for bringing the product to us.
26546,5,"This one made the life easy from day we bought it, previously it was like draining money for color printouts for kids projects and each color print out costed close to Rs 10. Once we had this printer hooking up was easy with Windows 7 and quick start up and then completing projects by kids was easy.

26549,5,"Nice all in one printer. Ordered it last week and got it delivered in a day to my surprise :) Nice Packaging. It comes with 2 demo Cartridges (1 Black/1 Color).

26576,5,hi friends this multifunction printer is very good at working.it is an amazing product....i really love this.its the best product in the range of 2k.every thing is fine with this product but a small pron is that the catridge is a bit costlier to buy....
26577,3,printer is in good condition and its worth of price i got this only for 1800 . by purchasing through mobile app. and this printer is only suitable for home purpose.
26578,5,"It has amazing printing quality to its price value and its light weighted.. Amazing packing by Flipkart. If u r budgeted and looking for a nice printer with all in 3-in-one facility then, this is the best choice. 5 stars"

26580,5,Flipkart delivered this product in 4 days. Nice Packing. Printing quality and Photo Print Speed is too good. We cant expect more in this Budget. It crops scanned docs automatically. Its really nice feature time. Overall I m very satisfied with this. And Coming to Ink Cartridges cost is very high. Better to fix ciss ink tank.

The Product is a good and user friendly, however very slow in printing in comparison to HP all in one printer also the INK received along with printer gave hardly 70 prints in Black and white before it finished, Colour print wasn't used much hence not sure about how long it will last and price for a black ink cartridge is approximately between 800- 900 rupees.  The Scanner works pretty wel..."

26584,4,Prints slowly but an awesome choice at a reasonable price. Highly recommend this product for anyone looking for a printer at home. Flipkart does a great job in delevering the product on time with minimum hassle.
26585,5,The most important thing is it has a refill friendly cartridge which according to me is a very important feature in the current market...the print quality is good...the scan quality is awesome..flipkart gave it to me within 16 hours..by which i was totally surprised...a must buy cuz its too good a machine for this price...
26586,5,Pros: Cost: The MRP is 3995-/ but in flipkart is cost 2990.  Was well packed and got it on time.  It can be attached to your PC/Tablet.  Easy to configure and use. Drivers can also be found online.  Auto Power On/Off  Cons Printing takes more time

26608,5,Nice product with good discount Does the well. Just used it for 10 days  Have to c the cartridge consumption
26609,4,"Does the job. Nothing great. Nothing bad so far. Ink consumption is a bit high. But its ok for occasional prints,"
26610,1,Ink consunption is very fast
26611,1,no action print
26612,1,After 10-20 copies the cartridge gets empty. You will have to buy a new ink cartridge @ RS 499 from Flipkart. So apparantly you will end up paying RS 25 per copy.
26613,5,"Product is very very nice. Scanning, copying and printing all the three operations are very accurate. Nice quality of all three features. Setup of printer is also very user friendly."
26614,5,verry good product

26618,4,Good
26619,1,plz dont by this product ink jet is verry cosly black in 500 - 15 pages only and color 800-10 pages only
26620,4,"cartridges are provided with this printer at the time in box package or not, because this is not specified in the sales"
26621,2,Cartridge is costier than printer...only 30 prints from the cartridge....Don't buy it...Spend more money in other products
26622,5,very good printer. printing quality is too good.
26623,1,Please don't buy this printer.. the cartridge gets over after 20 prints and scanner sometimes strucks I would like to say you to go for a ink tank printer where you can add inks..
26624,5,amazing and super thank you filpkart
26625,2,wow after 8 months usage i sold this coz iNk prices 60% of the amount of printer !! Keep calm store money go with laser jet or something else which cartridge supports refilling QQ
26626,5,v good product
26627,4,Product is very good....and good quality .... Packing was horrible...
26628,1,Dont buy this product guys this canon peoples are cheeters they dont know to manufacture the good product. i purchased 1 month back this printer. but no use boz it hase mentioned in to the cartrage that you can take 400 print were i took only 10 it showes cartrage is empty and i buyed new one that also same only 10. stop this selling product in to the market. now i need to through this printer to dustbin. do not buy it
26629,5,Best Printer
26630,4,nice product
26631,1,by using two to three months its getting problems...
26632,5,Very good product
26633,1,Not working properly..
26634,5,well finished pakage and the printer so u can buy it in cheap price.
26635,1,please do not sale
26636,5,nice work
26637,5,value for money product
26638,5,this product as good
26639,1,Its cartage will cost you a bomb.Lasts just 10 prints & costs Rs 800/-. Not worth it. Print quality is ok
26640,4,"GOOD, GOOD , GOOD"
26641,1,Not able to print. Alarm lamp is continuously blinking despite correct installation of cartridges and paper alignment.
26642,3,"Loss -  INK FINISHED BEFORE PRINTING 50 PAGES  Profit -  Nice printer Good printing quality Fast Cheap Take less space Easy to install Black as well as tricolour All in one printer Provide printing , copying and scanning Delivered before given date 1 year warranty."
26643,2,The Black color cartridge can print only around 50-60 papers after that we need to buy a new one which cost around 800.  The print quality is good the cost of refilling is too high
26644,5,I received good product iam satisfied let see the span
26645,5,nice value for money but it is not connect mobile to print
26646,5,Nice..
26647,5,good
26648,5,very very very very good super
26649,5,too good
26650,1,One cartridge costs around 600(medium) and i am getting 15-18 pages per cartridge ..so approximately i am paying 30rs for a page printout. If you are looking for a scanner...fine go for it. price of printer is inversely proportional to rs you pay for pages. Go for some printer in range of 6k to 7k. In long term you will reap benefit.
26651,4,it works properly.good product must buy
26652,2,good working
26653,5,Realy very nice product. Love it.
26654,3,"Quality is good. Two catridges are to be used. Cost is more (black1000,colour700). Not suitable for home needs."
26655,1,Very poor quality of product.As printer was delivered in time but it's a defective as its not working I have placed request for replacement but they have not responded to it and saying it request is rejected .So friends don't buy any thing from flipkart they are selling defective product and showing arogant behaviour with customers and return policy is very poor.
26656,5,Canon prefect
26657,5,good quality
26658,1,for 1 month it is best printer but after one month it is so costly ink was RS.1000-2000

26799,4,printer is best for home use. cartridge are costlier than HP. Got in Diwali season RS 1999/-
26800,3,the cartridge is quite expensive compared to printer and is hard to refill. they are earning more money through cartridge than printer itself.
26801,2,"very bad exirence with delivery, packing and handiver.. had to struggle alot.. apart product it quite ok in this price.."

26807,1,It gives very bad printing and it uses cartilage every day.
26808,4,Printers Price is good. Scanning are good. colour print out are 15-20 pages printed and ink cartridge over....
26809,3,Overall good...but loud sound while printing
26810,5,Very good printing...
26811,5,Super printer...üíúüíúüíú

26813,1,Don't buy it. Buy hp printer
26814,1,Too much poor quality of ink catridge.. Don't buy this product...
26815,1,It is an worst product the ink is for short time using
26816,5,Works well. Recommended for home use. No issues till now.
26817,1,"Though I got this printer at a very good price, I have had hard times using it. I have got cartidges changed twice despite using the printer for harday 100 copies."

26825,2,Good printing but cartridge is not maintaining briter ink capability
26826,4,Good product in this price. It is very good on use and quality.
26827,1,"It's a cheating seller , don't buy,"
26828,5,The printer is very good for printing and scanning @ home use. But its ink is expensive.
26829,1,"the performance of this printer in not good, printing speed is really bad and the main problem is the cartridge, it costs you too much every time and also not worth of the price."
26830,1,I have bought this product from flipkart just 4-5 weeks back and I am putting it up on OLX right away. 1. The scanner stops working if your ink runs out. Which is stupid because 2 functions should operate independently (like in HP - i should stuck to the same) 2. One ink cartridge gives only 6-7 full colour prints (i only use it to print pictures for my kid's school projects)\ Very annoying product.
26831,1,hello! please dont buy it this canon printer your lost your money printer is gud but cartage is so expensive colour pirice 1200 and black 1000. total cost 2200 printer cost 2300 and only 180 pages printe in one cartage

27547,5,This is the 2nd time I am buying this printer. This is a very good printer for ur home and not for heavy usage. I brought this printer again coz refilling of the catriges is very simple and can be done at home. I refilled my previous printer catriges almost 7-8 times. You can get many videos on utube on refilling Cannon pixma catriges. If u buy new cartriges it will cost u around Rs 600-700 for black and Rs 800-900 for colour. It's better if u refill the catriges at home every refilling will ...

Even if a customer later regrets the price of ink cartridges, he is unlikely to buy a new printer just because the ink is so expensive."

27757,1,Please don't buy this product. 1 took only one print then it's stopped to work
27758,1,It is not good
27759,1,After using 1 year I am writing  Product seems to good but it make you to spend more money to purchase New cartridges  Believe me never think to purchase it  It's very less efficient for avg class people Cartridges cost you approximately 15-18 hundreds of rupees  Print quality is not good as laser printer  After refilling not expect to see good results  It's very very very bad product it's not allowed you to scan after ink of cartridges goes less
27760,5,Spr
27761,5,Very good quality and nice model Satisfied
27762,2,"Printer works fine, but i would recommned not to buy this as the cartridges are very expensive."
27763,2,Don't buy it. The reason is printer cartige is very costly. One cartige you will printer 20 or 25 pages only and the cost of Black Cartage is 775/-.
27764,5,Fast delivery... Printer is good quality made in Thailand

27801,4,Mast product
27802,3,Printing quality is awesome but the cost of printing is too much so if your printing work is not much then definitely you can go for this but if you have to print more then the cost of cartridge will definitely be high for you as it just prints approax 50 pages in a single cartridge so do consider this point before buying..

29520,5,Good in printer but the ink cartridge cost is toooo much high and cartridge printing capacity is also to low
29521,1,"I purchased this product on April 2019, this printer worked well for a month only. with 100 of b/w printing default cartridge got empty. we purchased new cartridge package of original canon ink. From then it's started showing all offset problems. can't even print more than 50+ prints and print quality also became poor. we forced to stop using it after one visit to Canon service center and repeated problems."

30742,1,At very first day it was awesome but after 2 days it's shows ink to refill and scanning takes more than 5 minutes for a single paper scan. Average product... Product is cheap but the use of the product and purchasing cartridge is expensive. Fraud seller.

30770,1,Plzz dont buy Any Canon printer its ink cost is very high i hve brought ink cartridge for 500 bt it cant even print 50 pages rather than we can print it from shop it cost only 2 rs for 1 print if this cartridge can print 50 pages in 500 then 1 print is for 10 rs which is very costly nd we can print only 25/30 pages in colour print which cost 15 rs per print which is too costly nd this printer make lots of noise nd printing is very slow plzz i req u dont buy it
30771,2,I have an issue with this printer
30772,4,Good
30773,2,Very high ink consumption. In one black cartridge only 50 prints are printed
30774,3,It is little bit slow but over all performance is good. it is not pocket friendly as very less number of page printing capacity per catriage
30775,5,Just provide demo for printers
30776,4,"I bought this only just 2299/-, it's quite slow but good for educational purposes at home for minute use..."

30884,1,I am very happy I can receive my product on the time
30885,2,It is not working properly. Waste of money
30886,1,Worst product I have ever get from Flipcart. It's Ink toner has less capacity of ink & very costly to purchase. Can't be refilled. So you have to purchase the toner each time. Approx cost per toner is Rs.600. We can print only 100 to 130 pages per toner. Almost 6 rupees per page. So I suggest not to buy this printer.
30887,5,"after using it for some time i realised , laser printers are always economical than ink ones.."
30888,5,Good quality product
30889,5,Good product for thank you Canon & Flipcart

31040,1,Not for Business use. The cartridge gets over ever 10 pages print and it actually don't print after that. I had to refill everytime and then finally I just kept this printer on scrap and started using HP. Waste of money.
31041,4,Good For Home Use Consumes Ink Very Fast
31042,3,Ink exhausted too early. Improvement requires on driver software. The Printer became unserviceable within 3 years which was not acceptable to me. It seems there is a logic circuit in the Printer which prevents any more print facilities after a certain number of pages has been printed by the system.

31536,1,"Don't buy this printer. The printer uses more ink (mainly black) which drains so fast, also it cost nearly 900 -1000 whereas an ink toner of hp laser printer (monochrome) cost only 500 -600."
31537,4,Printing is good and user friendly. It has many good features. Only drawback is that Ink Catridge is costly. It costs nearly 1000 Rs. If you fill ink manually it costs only 150 to 200 only. Otherwise printer is good.
31538,1,Very bad printer
31539,3,This is a very nice printer WORTH OF MONEY
31540,5,Perfect to make it with ciss

31557,4,"Printer is good, carriage are expensive, hence printing cost is high, good for limited usage."

31629,3,"Ones the ink fully finished , the cartridge problem comes over , my mean when the company provides cartridge with ink and it finishes by uses but when we refill it with a proper ink, the emergency light comes to blink while we regularly pour some ink in it."
31630,1,"Don not buy this printer it is waste product,cartridges very high price. canon company worst company, poor peoples very upset who buy this product."
31631,4,Cost of prints may be high. For the time being product seems to be OK.
31632,5,Nice printer
31633,5,"I replaced my Epson TX121 with this due to some unfortunate malfunction. This printer's scanning is simply too good. It is fast, smooth, edge to edge and crisp. Printing is also ok but it does not print till corner of the page. However, I do not know it is because of some setting or it is default. Xerox is also ok. For home users, it is a good printer for just 2400/- Thank you, Flipkart"

31956,4,Nice all in one printer
31957,5,its work very nicely. so good
31958,1,Printer is good but cost of ink cartige is high. Printer produces very much noise. The quality of xerox is quite low. OPINION : The ink cartiges can be reuse. When the printer shows INK CARTIGE NOT DETECTING then solder the contacts of ink cartige with very thin layer. INK CARTIGE NOT DETECTING error shows only for the contacts on the cartige get eroded. I think its the policy of company to sold more costly cartiges. Friends i am using this printer for 1 year and i have done this on my cartig...
31959,5,Simply superb
31960,3,Nice product in low price

32005,5,We want ink
32006,1,"Printer is OK, but we can get print maximum 30 to 40, and its inkget cost is more than 1300 bugs each and I think canon don't need printer busness, they want inkget business, hence they are selling printer in low cost &it's inkjest higher cost than printer.  I hope we can get color copies from studios than to buy this product."

32057,1,Not good at all.........
32058,5,perfect thing at a cheap cost.
32059,1,Very bad don't buy plz
32060,3,Affordable printer cartridge capacity is less
32061,2,Printing qualty is good bt ink is too xpnsive
32062,3,Prints very less pages. Also cartridge is very cost black 900 and color 1500 and just prints approx 100 pages.
32063,4,Good printer for house use
32064,5,"Excellent product, thanks to the dealer, thanks to flipkart. Like to by 3 more if the product price come down."
32065,1,Worst shopping experience with Flipkart
32066,4,Good
32067,2,Good
32068,2,"It's an average product in terms of speed, works slow. Also the cartridge gets over quickly and is expensive to buy.. prefer a laser printer.."
32069,5,Nice product loved it
32070,1,It takes a lot of ink to print...
32071,1,I feel sorry for the decision to buy this product. Every 15 days I have to buy cartridge. Printer takes too much ink. Every print costs me Rs 10
32072,3,Printer is good. Flipkart delivered it in time. It was packed very nicely. It take some time to start. Printing speed is good. Scanner is also good. Price is also affordable. No dought about product. But cartridege is very costly. only 50-60 prints in one black cartridge. Cartridege price is near about Rs. 1000/- . For 50-60 prints Rs.1000/- is not economical. Company has to solve this cartridge problem. Cartridge prices should be very cheap.
32073,4,I Ordered it seeing its price and features. It is worth every money. GO FOR IT
32074,5,Good
32075,5,Good
32076,3,Not working

32080,5,Great Best product at this pricepoint
32081,2,"Bad product only consider it when you want to use it for one time... its ccartridges are costly, so beware before buying it"
32082,4,Useful for home purpose.
32083,4,Color Excelent
32084,5,It's good but should be free ink with pack
32085,4,Wonderful but not attqching to pc
32086,5,Fine quality
32087,5,V.v.v good excellent
32088,4,PRODUCT & DELIVERY ALSO GOOD BUT INVOICE BILL MISSING
32089,1,Not for scanning
32090,5,The product was delivered before the due date and that was amazing. But the only problem is that the ink smudges.
32091,5,Super
32092,2,very less ink in cartridge. It printed few papers only.
32093,1,Bad printer and black and colour carteage is not good don't buy thid product waste of money and wast of timr
32094,3,Printing is good but we must buy ink cartridges frequently.. at high cost . .. Maintaining the printer is costlier than the cost of printer..!
32095,5,REALLY USEFUL -IN THIS COST
32096,5,I got the product on time as mentioned... It is working very well...
32097,5,Fine
32098,5,IT's good its low cost no second thoughts go for it
32099,3,Printer comes with demo Ink . Ink is more costlier than printer.
32100,3,Product is ok not for commercial use but good for personly.
32101,5,good
32102,2,"Quality is good, but maintenance is too high. Too costly cartridge, its better to print from outside, not worth."
32103,3,Product quality is best in class
32104,4,Pretty good
32105,5,Its good... Thankyou flipkart
32106,2,I printed not more than 50-60 pages.. and it indicated low ink sign.. plz dont buy... otherwise its fine with other functions
32107,2,catriages are expensive
32108,4,Excellent budget printer
32109,1,I have purchased by flipcart. Very expensive printing
32110,3,i love it but injector cost is too much and printing only 35 to 50 pages at new
32111,4,This is that best printer in this coust thanks to flipkart
32112,1,Excellencent speed of delivery
32113,4,The quality of scanning and the printing are good. Nice buy for me. It really helps to have a scanner in your home.
32114,3,Nyc Product but Cartairige Not Good ??????????????
32115,3,Though the printer price is low this product very uneconomical product that yields very less number of prints. Cartridge price is very high.
32116,4,it is the best product to children for their personal use.but it gets heated while runnung and the paper jams in between the printt .....but it is the best
32117,5,"Works Fine. It takes a while when ever you starts the printer to print. Worth for the money I have paid. But the cartridge is too costly to replace, need to find out refill mechanism."
32118,3,DEVISE IS GOOD BUT PROVIDED INK QUANTITY IS VERY LESS PRINTING AND XEROX ARE GOOD BUT SCAN IN NOT SUPPORTED
32119,2,It was looking good at flipkart but when i brought it and started using it . I found that it dosent print well. The product was not good at all.
32120,3,THe product service is good but makes lot of noise during printing. Nice product in affordable price. It should be laserjet instead of inkjet.
32121,3,Dont go by the price of this product. Once the ink gets finished u wil hav to pay around 1700 bucks for the new catridges. The catridges within the box are S size. So there is no benefit in paying a amount for catridges which almost equal to the ptoduct-s value.
32122,1,i just print up to 200 pages with black. and cartridge is so high cost. just i loss my all money on this. but this is not value for money product.
32123,1,"One world ""useless"""
32124,1,Worst printer for students in low budget. Useless
32125,3,"Hi friends, this printer first it works good. After few days problems started."
32126,4,It is nice to have a printer at low cost which can do every thing.
32127,4,Very good one. Value for money. Scanner is the best amongst all 3
32128,4,Good printer but ink consumption is high and costly price of ink is more than printer
32129,3,Printer is very good but it has printed only 100 pages to refill it comes same cost of printer
32130,4,"Very nice product in its category with a decent performance in printing ,copy and also in scan.The product reached with in the time."
32131,4,"good, i bought it when it was1800 from flipkart.it worked perfectly,. Only problem is you have to remove and put catridges again and again to make sure it detects. i dont know whther i got fault piece or all such products have such problem. but it works perfectly fine. dont expect ink to long last/. maximum 100 pages black and white and 30 pages colour"
32132,4,"Very useful product, thanks for all the reviewers without whom I wouldnt have chosen this product. Thanks to flipkart for making positive changes in people lives."
32133,5,"Good products delivery, Very fast delivery. I love this printer because this is budget friendly."
32134,5,This one has a full sealed black and colour cartridges on it which if not cost u around 2000 bucks but u r getting it free. great working printer scanner and copier. no flaws
32135,1,GUYS NEVER PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT. BECAUSE : 1- U CAN NOT REFILL THIS CARTRIDGE. THIS IS ONLY ONE TIME USE. I HAVE PURCHASED THIS PRINTER LAST YEAR DIWALI. SINCE THAT I NEVER BOUGHT THIS AND LOST ASSURED FORM FLIPKART IT IS VERY BAD..
32136,2,"i had hp 1050 earlier and was far better than this product... per page printing cost is very high, colour ink level goes down even if you dont use it and there is some some hardware issue too as many times i have to reset it as it shows some error 5100 randomly. in short not a good product"
32137,1,printing quality is good but the printer can be considered as free of cost. The money charged is for inks cartridges. Cartridges are same cost as new printer.
32138,5,delivery is good in time for ws retailer on flipkart and product is good . just a suggestion i u can give combo offers on printers with ink and extended warrenty
32139,4,nice product. canon is always good. :-) handy for students and all domestic purpose.. All the 3 functions work very well.
32140,4,its good i used it almost 6 hour continuously.but i don't have any problem. follow the manual everybody will use it so easily other wise connect canon India.they too help u.there is nothing problematic that u bought it from a online shopping store actually its good. i will give 7 out of 10
32141,5,Excellent product Perfect for budget Print quality is excellent As cartridge is small I use additional inks to fill the cartridge.
32142,4,Delivery was on time .Its easy to install and use. Prinitng quality and speed is good .I use this printer for my submission and college work. it is reliable. o
32143,1,"Printer is not recognized by the computer, giving error message as printer drivers not installed properly, tried multiple time but no luck."
32144,4,"I don't know about cartridge, But currently it's working fine for me. Able to Print, Copy and Scan documents."
32145,5,"First of all, I strongly recommend you guys to buy this product, This is a awesome printer. As, you can see in description that this product gives, around 180 pages, but in actual it give 250 colour pages and 220 black pages approximately. Please go for it even thinking for a sec."
32146,1,"product was good.delivery was fast asusual.bt ink is costly than printer itself..... so dont buy...ifstill want to buy this dont purchase ink bt buy a new printer every time , take out ink cartidges n selll brand new printer"
32147,5,Bought it in a scheme...useful for me as i do less printing. Print is of good quality and overall satisfaction is good
32148,5,i found this printer awesome .its definitely the same which i desired thanku flipkart for your wonderful service.........
32149,5,my order was cancelled i have order the canon injet printer . it was cancelled by flipkart .. i need my order its my request
32150,3,Received the product from Flipkart earlier than schedule delivery time. Printer was Easy to install. Printer driver downloaded from CANON. Easy operate and cons are that cost per page and drying on non-use.
32151,5,"I have brought this printer two weeks before. The print quality of this printer is very good both color print and black print. The printer having many function like we can scan,copy and print the documents. As per price printer is too much good.  I have printed more than 50 papers still the cartage is working properly."
32152,4,"After checking the functions (copy, scan,print) Mg 2470 printer good enough for home purpose.. best buy at rs. 2000.color print quality also good. overall am satisfied."
32153,5,Awesome printer and the print quality is awesome guys i loved it
32154,4,i got it rs 1899 via this special link :- http://fkrt.it/WwPkWNNNNN thanks to flipkart  ok   THKZ i love flipkart   o
32155,1,"The print quality is good, but the cartridge provided with the printer is very low quantity. It ran out within less than 50pages. Highly disappointed with it."
32156,5,nice product to use it. the product from WS is the best product. you can buy the product and from it.
32157,5,Dont Buy 2570 But Buy This Model B'cause All Specifications Are Same And 2470's Price Is Low. Good Picture Quality even In Photo. I Recommend this to every one.
32158,5,The printing quality is amazing and the scanning and copying functions are a plus point. All this for just Rs.2199 is a steal deal. It was delivered within 48 hours ensuring the good flipkart service and it was packed quiet neatly.
32159,5,I've been using this since i've purchased and i never felt disappointed on the print. So i can say that this Inkjet printer is good and has awesome picture quality. I don't say that this is the best but i can say that this is good. Thank you flipkart.
32160,5,Good product..working good right choice to buy this thank you flipkart..
32161,4,Easy installation and easy print. But taking 15-20 secs for color copies. Product quality is average but functionality wise very good.
32162,3,Good product... Fair price... . Bt only one problem... the ink cartridge is much costly and ink wont last long...
32163,1,It is a multi functioned ink jet which works good but curtrige finished very fast . new curtrige most costly .
32164,5,the printer was very helpful to me as I need to go to the stationary and wait for my chance for printing but only at home only I can take out my prints as now it is winter than it is very difficult for me to go and wait for printer . I AM VERY HAPPY
32165,4,"for refilling of black cartridge or color cartridge, refill it y making a hole deep inside of the cartridge. but your printer will still show you error. then just press stop button for 30 second and left it.........some time it gave me headache. then call your customer service engineer, when he look at your home asked him directly all the problems. but dont say on phone."
32166,4,"Canon MG2470 is the exact device needed by me - printer, scanner and copier with WiFi connectivity. The quality of prints is pretty good considering the price for the printer. However the ink cartridge did not last even 40 prints."
32167,5,"it have good print quality ,but it produced little noise when printing time,scan quality is average,i got the product @price of 1999 on diwalie offer.i like the ws retailer also.they provided good packing and quality product"
32168,4,Good printer at amazing price . only concern is price of cartridges.
32169,4,Use only home.....print very costly
32170,5,"The only con I faced was downloading the Mac drivers separately.  Best Printer/Scanner at this price, its practically a steal."
32171,5,canon software is pretty good... scanner working fastly and scans very clear images... i satisfy by this price .....
32172,4,Very fast delivery..and the product is very good..the printing quality is also surprising..
32173,4,This printer scanner copier is very good for home use since i have a canon lbp2900b laserjet allb/w is done there the colored part is done here printing speed is less -can manage with a budget printer catridge price is more -negative  the user software is very user friendly  it prints a limited amt of pages  the catridges given with the printer are test only catridges the empty soon dont worry the ones u buy wont get over soon  Thank You !
32174,5,the product is great in such a low price offered by flipkart... !!! extremely happy the product's performance ... and it was delivered in 1 day... !!! if you are looking for deals in this range ... you should go for this product ... !!!
32175,5,Canon PIXMA MG2470 All-in-One Inkjet Printer IT WAS AN GOOD PRODUCT I LOVE THIS SHIPPING ALSO GOOD
32176,4,"good for regular home usage.make a little noise while printing,but you have to compromise at this price rate.printing quality for document printing is good.so over all a 4 star."
32177,5,Good offer by Flipkart.. But it is only useful for home purpose for limited prints as Ink consumption is very fast
32178,4,IT IS NICE BUT DOES NOT WORK WITH ANDROID KITKAT INK CARTRIDGE ARE VERY EXPENSIVE IT HAS 3.5 ML NOZZLE WHEREAS HP DESKJET 5 ML
32179,4,"its a good printer - small & perfect for home use/ personal use, good quality prints. Only problem is that the number of prints per cartilage/ink refill is very bad."
32180,1,canon pixma is not good because there is very high cartilage cost.there is very slow printing and bad scanning.
32181,3,"I am using this printer from last 2 months but after 10-20 print, the Cartridge indication shows that the ink is very low and also every time i am facing a problem that the printer will not taking input paper for print, when a user commends Print then printer shows that Ink is Empty Or Not Taking Paper Inside Properly"
32182,5,nice product at reasonable price .............................................................................................................................
32183,5,the cost of new cartridge is high i prefer to buy hp printers and also not scan big size than A4 papers such as legal.
32184,4,"The printer is quite impressive and quality of output is also excellent. Particularly scanning quality and color printing quality is excellent. However I found one problem, don't know how it occurred, but cartilages (particularly black cartilage) is not working well. I have taken merely 40-50 prints (including both color and grey-scale) and it is showing error with black color quantity and also not letting me to take any black and white printouts. Rest all is OK!!"
32185,2,this is very cheap price than quality of printer & seller v good product m using it without any problem if any one want i can share him any printed picture by this printer.
32186,4,"Printer quality is not that good, but scanner is very nice. Takes time to load and start up. Scanner works quite good. Worth buying product. and cheaper."
32187,5,I was quiet skeptical about the product till I received it.The prints were amazing.I don't have to rush for photocopy.My kids projects are now being completed even in odd hours from the comfort of my home.Good job Flipkart!
32188,4,"The 3 in 1 does what its meant to do with ease.  Pros: Lightweight Speed Easy to Operate  Cons: Nothing major, just that it consumes too much ink."
32189,5,I am using this product....print quality is very good...in this price this is very best for home use.
32190,5,Its a Very Good Printer against price category....... ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Perfectly designed for home use.
32191,4,"print quality is good, best for personal use, some time it pick more than one page at a time, overall it's good."
32192,1,"This printer is only for scanning if you print copies the cartridge will exhaust soon, taking Xerox and printing copies at internet centre are very much cheaper than printing from this printer"
32193,4,fine good con good scan good print good multifun smail price good worth good product. good product Canon PIXMA MG2470 All-in-One Inkjet Printer
32194,5,The Printer Speed is awesome in Black & White mode. The colour printing speed is also very good. I have printed Photographs on Photo Paper . The Quality is very nice. I am very satisfied with the printer
32195,5,"Before buying the calculation I made was I thought of any of the following: printing 1000 pages/scanning 500 pages/xeroxing 2000 pages would be enough to cover my purchase cost, and it didnt fail me."
32196,5,Canon PIXMA MG2470 All-in-One Inkjet Printer a very good product in low cost amazing color quality.the trey can hold 60 pages at a time .
32197,1,"Easy to use for home & office...It has all the feature which makes this printer as a ""Best Companion"""

32199,5,Was delivered within 24 hours. What I got with this very neat looking printer -  1. connecting cables 2. color + black ink cartridges   Ideal for home use. Good product. And the price was a steal.  Cheers to Flipkart :)
32200,1,"i like this product but if i pucrchase online its totally time waste bcoz flipkart executives said item would be replace but if i say yes then they will pick-up old iten in 3 days, after that they will send the new product.. so they will take minimum 6 days for delevry 6 3=9 days i will have to wait.. so why they cant send only cartridge.. bcoz if they send only cartridge i will have to wait only 2 to 6 days.."
32201,4,"Ordered this product on Tuesday night and got it delivered on Thursday noon! Wow Flipkart! And packing was supreme.. Speaking about the product itself, it is a real VFM but its not built to last which is the only flaw in an otherwise, a great product. Seamless printing, copying and of course those Scans! Very easy to install and use. Except for those regular snags that come associated with inkjet printers, it has nothing to complain about..  I say Go for it.."
32202,4,"Its a nice, easy to use.printer. The only small irritation could be the sound created while loading paper. Worth buying."
32203,5,"product is good and earlier i have used EPSON,HP in same category and from that side it is a nice one but the delivery process by flipkart is not so good.I am not writing the detail about the delivery process over here."
32204,2,"ACCORDING TO PRICE ITS OK ,BUT THERE NEED TO BE SOME IMPROVEMENT IN SOFTWARE AFTER INSTALLING HE DEVICES SPECIALLY IN GLOSSY PAPER IT PRINT IN A4 SIZE, SINCE USING IT FORM 3 DAYS. AT SEE WHAT GOOD OR BAD THINGS COME OUT."
32205,1,"i brought it two days earlier but today it is not working properly.please not purchase it . so, poor performance."
32206,1,"bad model , not at all user friendly at all and have lot of issues needless to say about the issues please dont buy this perticular model"
32207,3,"good for home use, cost of cartridge high,non refill , approx 50-60 prints only.easy operating oooooooooookay"
32208,2,its amazing with black and colour cartriage packed very well with extra air seal packs for extra support
32209,4,I actually bought it to use for my own purpose of printing on occasional need. I Love the working of the printer.
32210,1,"Printer running with good condition but now a day they don't have show black ink and they are not print above. they have 1 year canon warranty. please do needful to product, faces lot of problem to printing."
32211,1,It cannot print photo on a A4 size photo paper and it leaves a large border on page which is wastage of paper. It can only print photo on a 4R or 4 inch X 6 inch paper
32212,4,"Its light, compact and great. The delivery was quick and installation was very quick. Wish the connector cable between the PC and the printer could be a bit longer. Its worth buying."
32213,1,bad...bad worst product......it costs Rs.1000 for a black in....which gives u approx 100 print.....i was a fool that i bought this one...if you wanna another fool then please buy this jhandu printer....& make your life hellllllll.....good for even not nothing.......
32214,3,the printer is excellent and the prints are also very good.....but the cartridge cost is very much expensive compared to other hp printers............
32215,1,"Canon Printer is very bad , only HP printer is best . plz dont buy canon printer . only buy HP company printer for work"
32216,3,"price wise item is very good, but very soon the cartidge of the printer will be empty. if refill of cartige will success then ok, if not then you have to purchase it again by rupee near about 1k"
32217,3,"Printing quality is very good. Scanner is not of high resolution but o.k. This machine also works like a photo state machine. Since its an inkjet printer, number of pages can be printed per cartridge may be low."
32218,1,"Please don't buy, INK hardly last for a couple of prints. The cartridge is damn costly, Replacing both cartridges costs almost equal to buying another printer. And if you think refilling is an option. The refill ink easily leaks through the bottom, creating an error in the printer. Which in turn voids the warranty. Please don't waste your money."
32219,1,i have purchased this product for 1843 odd . it wont give hardly 25 pages at least.even refilling is undesirable. now i am using it only for scanning which is good .in total I won't recommend to buy this.
32220,1,After using it 6 months i can say that it is waste of money its cartridge cost is too high...please dont buy
32221,5,"Excellent Product ""Canon PIXMA MG2470 All-in-One Inkjet Printer"".  Received ordered product immediately in 3days. Checked the functions of the Printer working fine."
32222,2,"i use this product, but not 100% satisfied with this. functioning properly, good at this price but its very Ink Hungry Printer.  Ink Eat at Very High Speed.  May be 50 pages print with one ink cartage ."
32223,3,ink cartidge is too small extra page margin non refilable ink new ink cartidge is costly then printer so buy with a smart decison
32224,5,"Very good experience.  I have not noticed any loss in ink cartridge ever after printing many pages as many reviewers have suggested.  All the functions are working as they are supposed to, printing quality is very good. I am fully satisfied with the product. The most amazing part is its price."
32225,3,i am using this printer for multi purpose... mostly scanning and color printing.. SUPER SPEED SCANNER... various resolution it will take in few seconds... good printing Quality...Especially for SCANNING...
32226,5,"Very good price , multiple use gr8 deal.Very good product in cheap priceVery good product in cheap price"
32227,5,"If you are looking for an all-in-one device, this is the best investment you can make. Apart from the expensive cartridges, the device will work as you expect it to.  Scanner - 5/5 Printer - 5/5 Quality - Excellent"
32228,5,"Flipkart delivbery on time. No issues with setup.  Pros: canon has made a product with valid instructions and it was ready in no time.  Cons: Needs drivers for installation, no plug n play. Software has many features, but should have had a lite version. I will not use 80% of these. Rest all is fine."
32229,4,"i have bought this product 2 months back. the basic problem with this inkjet printer is that the ink cartridge empty very quickly so dont buy inkjets when u have more to spend, otherwise it is affordable at a nominal price along with others functions of scanning, and xerox."
32230,1,"FOR PROPER UTILITY OF ANY PRODUCT OF THIS KIND, A DEMO BY A SKILLED TECHNICIAN SHOULD BE INITIATED. FOR TECHNICAL SOFTWARE ISSUES, INSTALLATION ISSUES AND UTILITY ISSUES IF ANY."
32231,1,"iam useing it .ink is not suffitient, aproximate 50 copies only ......................................................................................................................................................"
32232,4,Good Printer Print is so good but its Catridge price is some what high Printer is suitable for home and office use
32233,1,"Don't buy it, simply waste of money and worst product.. The cartridge ckt shorts every time.. Expensive cartridge.."
32234,5,"This is best product in cheap prize. 3 functions(Scanning, Printing and copying), fast printing and scanning process."
32235,2,I got this Billion day sale. It took time setting up the printer. Gets the work done. But uneconomical considering per Page print cost.  Ease of use 3/5 INK consumption 2/5 Economy 2/5
32236,5,east or west this printer is the best sooo gooooooooood swettttt and hooott very very usefull product
32237,3,ok product........  good for basic use.................  over all average........................................................................
32238,4,"Go head with this product easy to take the copies and scanning purposes, but cartridges getting dry soon, If you use in light mode it stays for a long."
32239,5,"I bought it for purpose of scanning older docs n papers. I bought it at 2000/-. Really worth of price I spent.  those who r looking for scanner, xerox n Print Both clor n B&W, I suggest this for sure for home use.  color print quality is good.  some people wrote it lags for Fax etc.,  those features r not possible to fit in this price range. and users can install softwares for the functions like fax etc.."
32240,4,"Good at that price,but not better it make much sound while printing,scanning and even in xerox also........"
32241,5,i bought it for my childern for their school work and it is very useful to them and for me nice product at areasonable price
32242,1,"This printer will not print on systems other than Windows. On my computer, it prints neither on Linux nor FreeBSD. On Windows, the ink-efficiency is pathetic - I got only 25 pages of B/W printouts before the cartridge dried up. The scanner is software-based and works only under Windows. Stay away from Canon. This company is another Microsoft stooge."
32243,4,Print quality is OK....... Cartridges drain faster than the speed of light.......... But you can go for refills.... which also gives quite good results
32244,5,"nice printer in  would have given 5 stars but rate of the cartilages are very high, printing is good,but the process is quite take some time for everything but at this price what more that we would except from it overall it is an nice product for home uses"
32245,1,printer is working good print quality is also good but the only problem is ink consumption is very high specialy black my one ink is finished after a few days use otherwise product is good for home use
32246,4,i bought it this week.and its so far good.took almost 200 pages.and good part is ink works well even at low ink status unlike hp ink.scanner to good.over all nice product at this price.
32247,4,it a good product for home use at a unbelivable price thanks to flipcart i always prefer flipcar for online shoping it is a googd experiance for me and my family isuggest all of you go for flipcar.....
32248,5,It does what it says!!!! Lastly thanks to Flipkart!!!! I would rather say go for it however not for professional printer user......
32249,5,"vey nice printer at low cost with all features, print quality is vey good also scan quality is also very good"
32250,5,Its is a great printer.It is quite good.Everything is software desing from scan to print.That is one of a good point atleast for me. People have critised abt it but for me its asum.Prefect for home use at just Rs 2099..Thanks Flipkart.
32251,4,"i have used this for home use and its excellent its quality is good, it is very suitable for home use.it also print colored and black and white color."
32252,3,"It is a good product for that budget. All in one is really all in one. Print quality is good. Scanner is fully functional.I have been using it for last 2 months, till now no problem such. Though i had to replace the first product. But now i am satisfied."
32253,5,iam using this printer and iam very much satisfied with it an i bought it for 1792 as an offer so according to its price its very affordable
32254,2,this printer is faulty .I buy this printer before 2 week and i print only 24 pages and cartridge is empty. so don't buy this product.
32255,3,Till yet not used...so no comment..later will give right view . But packing were good & delivered on time .
32256,5,"I have bought it just 2 weeks back. It easy to operate, convenient. So far so gud. Will update this, a month later."
32257,5,Does everything good. No bad experiences.  Works upto the expectations.  Scan resolution is great. Print quality of photo and plain paper is uncompromized after cartridge head alignment.
32258,4,product is good but packing is no so good at all  printer works good for my lap without any problem..................................................................................................................
32259,4,"Getting it in discount is nice, however being a inkjet printer it can only be used for emergency purpose at home, but scanner function can be used in usual way, however does not have automatic function in taking papers."
32260,5,"I feel it is easier to assemble the cartridges, and installing the software. Very easy to operate. The multi functions copier and the printer are very useful."
32261,5,no issues and prints like magic only thing is rate of print is slow   if not for that every thing else works smooth  easy to put it together
32262,3,nice printer... it s so good for this price section.... i am feel happy.. any one want low cost printer select this one..
32263,5,Needed a small printer for home for occasional printing. Had a similar HP before but that ink dried twice coz I left it idle for couple of weeks. What a waste that was! So this time it's Canon's turn and so far haven't been disappointed. Installed quite easily and does what it's supposed to do.. even after I left it idle for more than 2 weeks. Some people have commented about high printing costs but let me remind you - this printer is for occasional printing/copying/scanning at home coz you d...
32264,5,great product. working fine. printing quality is also excellent. I just want to focus on one thing and i.e. the cartridge is too costly.
32265,5,"The product was delivered in just 2 days. Light weight machine, Easy to install, print quality is good. Overall good product. Thanks to canon and Flipkart"
32266,4,This printer is so usefull and at a good price. so it is preety good for me. This comes with multiple facility that i like........
32267,5,"We have to install the package provided in the CD which installs drivers and software's. For scanning, we can scan and save it in our desired folder. The software has many other options as well. For copy, in a click of a button, we get the a xerox (color/black & white). Since it easier, even aged people can operate with it. For printing, it just straight-forward."
32268,1,This is really highly useless and outdated product. The support on this by Canon is not available. money waste friends DO NOT BUY THIS
32269,4,hi frnds i get canon pixma printer its nice wroking printer u do not get this type of multi functional printer at this price gud printer to have it ....the week point is cartridge is bit costly but gud for home purpose.....
32270,5,Rs. 1942/- m aur kya logo...frnds...  nic offer frm flipkart...  with two catrigde one is colour and black ....but catrigde rate bit costly ...black is 800 and colour is 1100 rs ....anyways printer small and awesome ...
32271,4,"It is very good for home use. Very cheap multipurpose printer. Better for emergency printing, scanning, copying both color and B/W. Because it consumes more ink. Cartridge costs more."
32272,4,Good Printer But uses More INK Scanning Systerm really nice Printing speed Takes 14-18 seconds I Reccomend This Printer But ink Is so Costly
32273,4,Good.. scan is good.. sample prints looks good....but yet to look for more print outs.............................
32274,4,good va;ue for money.. one drawback that i have found is that ink provided with the package got emptied after printing almost 50 pages..
32275,5,I got this product on Big Bang Sale with a cost of Rs. 0/-  I will give rating 5/5 to this product.
32276,5,Packaging good! Bought on big billion day! delivery within 24 hours!( Bangalore buyers you dont need (in-a-Day at all)  Good product quality is clean! I retro fitted liquid cartridges saw it on YouTube. Printed 340 pages ! economically @85 paise a print! Color costs would be 4/- a page roughly
32277,5,Friends if u r going to buy a printer for lowest cost Pls just go ahead with this it is Quite Good and power ful It has Three in One.... A small one with all in all...
32278,5,"purchased this for 0 rupees on Flipkart. For the price i'd say the printer is really good. As for people claiming the printer is slow its as fast as a inkjet can get. The print result is actually decent, have tried printing pictures on glossy paper and the results have been great"
32279,2,Printing is very slow ink doesn't last long  scan and print quality if fine ok for occasional printing
32280,1,"I have ordered many products from Flipkart and was always happy with quality and fast delivery. This is the first time I received a defective product and to my surprise this printer was struggling to power on. It's an all-in-one printer but nothing worked. Power light kept flashing continuously. After I installed the software and connected the printer, got an error that says ""printer needs to be repaired"". I am sure this piece might have failed the quality check but somehow made it to wareho..."
32281,3,I was supposed to receive this printer on October 10th but got it on 19th October. The packing was bad. It was not expected from flipkart.  Anyway Regarding the Printer:  Pro's Cheap! Cheap! Cheap! It is not heavy and as good as portable.  Cons' Very poor Quality of Print. Scanning quality not good Will give 100 pages per B/W cartridge and 60 pages for Colour Cartridge.   Plz Dont buy it. And not from Flipkart for sure
32282,4,"Hi, This printer is definitely a good budget printer cum scanner with copy feature. Only drawback is that few portion of side edges of an A4 paper is not coming while scanning. But as always, it was a excellent packaging and one day delivery by WS Retail on flipkart. Thank you Flipkart and WS Retail."
32283,5,"Excellent offer and Delivery by Flipkart, Product was very good and it was a steal for the price of Rs 2800"

32287,5,Got it delivered from fk within a day which is awsome and in 2449k price I don think any cons in the product is worthy of mentioning. Speed of printing is a bit on the slower side.

32290,4,"This is very good option for Home/Personal use.  Pros: Basic job (PRINT, SCAN) well. Light Weight. Easy Maintainence and Connectivity with my Laptop/Computer because of USB port.  Cons: Paper printing is a bit slow and not too many options for Scanning the image"

32444,1,"It is really surprising how flipkart deliver product, without testing the product. When i receive the Canon Pixma MG2470, after instalation it is not working. When I called the Canon Customer Care, they told that printer is already damage, you have to wait for 7 days to get new parts, because it is not available right now.  I am really confuse, what to do i will replace or wait for 7 days for new parts. It is really pathetic service."
32445,1,Not a good product
32446,1,"I felt horrible experience with service centre, they took more than 25 days in order to repair, first they said it be replaced then after they didn't even give the parts recipt were changed"

Its new cartridge don't even last 80 pages and cost of cartridge is 800 bucks . market print out cost is 2 rs . So even you get product in free don't buy. In longer terms it will be damn expensive , better to go with HP. What i learnt after buying this product is check out for cost of cartridge how much pages it will last.Even that..."
32450,3,The item is genuine but it take ink make more consumption or cost to you.

32455,4,not worh as if you are looking to print 5-10 pages a month at maximum than you can buy because of canon and flipkart else it is not worth. 50-60 pages and cartrage over. scanner is very good. 2 star for scanner and easy installation plus look.
32456,1,"I brought this printer for 2,300/- in Hyderabad.there is no value for this printer without catridge, cartridge can not working if you fill it,you have to buy new one every time,which costs single black colour only is Rs.950 to 1050. Use and throw away item.if you buy both color and black means it's cost you more than a printer cost,"
32457,1,Received the product next day of ordering and the product is faulty and showing Erorr 5011 And Erorr -5100.  Worst service from flipkart. It took around 10-20 calls to customer care to convince them to return the product and initiate my refund.  This was my last order from flipkart.
32458,1,It is useless and wastage of money. After using one week I have to sell in kabadi shop....

32460,5,"After placing order, the printer delivered within a narrow span, as soon the installation took place, an error '5011' occurred, I wrote regarding the matter with the request to replace the machine. An executive talked and assured me to solve the matter, got a massage for pickup, and there after the new machine has been delivered within a short span too. And now it is working nicely. Hats off to ""Flipkart""."

32465,1,"Received the product on 5th April Called flipkart customer care & asked them when installation will be done, he said that you can do it by yourself. But the printer showed some error i guess 5011(Something like that), so i again called Flipkart CC and another executive told me to wait for 48 hour, you will get a call for installation, but again no call after 2 days also. So, I again called Flipkart customer care to ask them if someone would be coming for installation or i want to return this..."
32466,1,This Printer Just prints 100 page at a time.Also it shows error even though the catridge is filled fully

32468,4,Prompt delivery and product exactly as described. Good product at minimum prices. Got value for money.
32469,5,Always a good experience with flipkart. Great product plus delivery on time. kudos to you guys..
32470,1,"I bought after saw very low prices 2400, they will give youbdemo catridge whcih will take around 30 pages, then after you have to purchase from market good quality will coat you around 900 for single catridge. And to your horror stationery guys will tell you it can't be refilled that means every time you have to buy new one so guys take your decisions wisely."

I talked to canon about number of pages it can print (180) with a set of new cartridges..now here is the math I did.. color ink - INR 1355 (CL746) black ink - INR - 899 (PG745) Total cost - 2254 Now you can not use 100% of this ink in printing 1. some % of the ink will be used for print head health 2. some will evaporate 3. some will be residual Lets guess,you waste 30% of the t..."
32479,2,"i spoke to flipkarts sales executive to know how much printout give by colour , B/W cartridge of PIXMA M2470 . he said around 160 by B/W and 160 by colour cartridges. i took only 98 printout by b/w cartridge and 87 by colour cartidge. printer PIXMA M2470 is average printer in that cost .

I need the same printer in same price . Horrible Horrible experience with flipkart . DO NOT BUY FORM FLIPKART THEY ARE FRAUD !!!"
32482,1,"it prints very slow, takes many pages at once and then there are paper jams, Quality of print is poor and misses out print, only able to print 35-40 pages.. Called flipkart but they refused to provide me any other printer.. After days of calling they agree to send me same make and model but haven't received it since 15 days, tired of calling again and again but no solution.. Bought HP 1510 from retail shop and that works fine. bad product and really poor service by flipkart."

32486,3,"it is curious to see the good speed of canon pixma with print , copy and scan. but one fault it makes is that it cannot reduce the ink consumption. it simply engulfs both black and coloured inks , but still it is best budget printer in flipkart till date...."
32487,1,"It is a worst product and deal which i don't suggest any one to buy.This deal absolutely fake and marketing attraction strategy was followed by the company.From the first cartridge, the no of copies which they promised was not fulfilled.Selling printer at the low price,and collecting the variable from selling cartridge."
32488,1,"Printed not more than 30-40 pages in black ink, and its cartridge was empty. takes a lot of time in printing/copying any document. makes odd sounds while printing. I suggest other buyers not to buy this model."

32498,1,"It was very bad experience on dealing with flipkart. I ordered this product, they shipped and after two days they cancelled my order. When I contact with the costumer service, they asked me to order once more, and when I was doing that they increased the money by almost 400/- rupees. And the funniest think, they didnit even refunded my money yet !!_ SO GUYS BEWARE AND THINK BEFORE YOU DO SOMETHING !!! DON'T GET CHEATED !"
32499,1,I purchased this printer from Flipkart on BB day sale. When I received that I assembled it but it is always showing error. Yellow light keeps on blinking. When I asked for return WS Retail rejected return without any reason. Flipkart service is becoming poor now-a-days.

32503,5,This printer doesn't say windows or mac This printer specs doesn't mention whether black only printing is allowed...if the colour ink runs dry. some HP models don't allow black only printing ....if the colours run out .. and its better to avoid such brands

But the product isn't become good for working, my both the cartridge damaged only by setting. This type of setting customer can't do because it is a internal defect.

32530,3,I recently purchased a Canon printer Canon Pixma MG2470 i am facing the error once insert the cartridges getting yellow alert. could you please help me anyone.
32531,1,"When I order this product, not working ,as printer not detecting cartiage, while scanner also not working, waiting for product replacement from flipcart.."
32532,1,"i ordered Canon PIXMA MG2470 All-in-One Inkjet Printer on this diwali when i received on 29 oct i disappointed by this product, how flip-kart can cheated us i received printer without cartridges. i want my money back please"
32533,5,Awesome product fast printing and scanning is also good and it is easy to setup but it is not wireless otherwise awesome
32534,3,This product is good but the paper cost very high.. House Work is good but Business Work is Not Good..
32535,1,"Never buy an inkjet printer for any purpose coss these printers could not be returned if u are not satisfied by it. Cartridge provided with the printer consist of low ink hp calling it as trial purpose ,after 2-3 fillings u have to buy new cartridge as it declared useless by the printer. Cartridges filling is not good idea in these printers as it wastes half of it's ink duing every cleaning. Buy inktank as they are too efficient"
32536,3,Ink cartridge provided with it could not print even 60 black prints had to buy a refill ink .So if you have thought to buy remember to include the cost of the ink as well as the ink won't last long well the print quality is appreciable and good enough for home use .
32537,5,"Extremely Good Product.The best print quality one can get. If you are on the track of purchasing it ,go ahead I can guarantee that you won't regret. A priceworthy and one of the best product by HP team to us .Thank You!!"
32538,5,Superb product
32539,1,very bad product... it shows low ink after printing arounrd 50 pages and ink cartridge is very costly around 2000 rs and prints only 100 pages go and buy another printer

32542,4,Good product
32543,5,Supob printer
32544,3,After 40 to 50 prints the ink cartridge will be low . Per printout the estimate cost is 5 to 7 rupees . And to buy another cartridge it cost around 800 rupees. It is very expensive because the ink will use more for print. I am really disappointed about the ink cartridge. It doesn't fit for small business or student because its ink cartridge is expensive and hardly we can take around 40 to 50 printout..

Print/Scan/Copy all are working excellent. - You will get a wide range of options as input while using the scanner. Also, the print quality is good. - It will be slow in printing as this is a DESKJET printer. This is normal. - If you want faster print you have to spend more for the laser printer. Spend money and get faster speed."

33228,1,"Inferior product - one of the worst from Dell. Even a laptop screen second hand is better than this. Inferior quality LCD screen parts used. Display has round white marks within 10 days. Reducing clarity of display of numbers. Not recommended to use for work/business purposes.  Power plug send with this item is not of Indian standard. It is a very large power plug, send on purpose so that the return policy of 10 days will lapse."

33633,5,"Before describing the monitor itself, I want to mention that I am extremely pleased by the seller and delivery. I ordered this on Saturday afternoon and I had it with me on Sunday afternoon. Fastest delivery that I've ever had.  The box comes with a HDMI and a VGA cable. The screen has a very basic I/O: Just one for VGA and HDMI each. No speakers on the monitor. The monitor stand is fixed, cannot be adjusted for height or swivel. That said, it looks very nice on my desk. The screen is very sl..."

33635,5,"Perfect aspect ratio , colours are good . Slim and sleek design . Best in this price range ."
33636,4,"Not five star because the response time is not suitable for gaming purposes therefore it is a general purpose monitor. Hope this helps. Brightness is good, and its a good one at this price specially impressed by the 3 year guarantee claim made by the dealer."
33637,5,Got this beauty at just 9300. A pretty good deal for a 24inch IPS monitor. Great color production and the looks pretty slick.
33638,5,Awesome product. Nice display. Gives some flickering in screen if connected via VGA but crystal clear clarity if connected via HDMI. Worth buying and value for money.
33639,5,"I've been using it since a year and here is my conclusion... the display is very good colours are accurate and the resolution is really full hd and it gives full screen experience, just the bezel at the bottom is a bit annoying. there are some difference in colours of monitor and smartphone or other device but I noticed it in every monitor. all and all it's a good product, you should try it out."

33642,4,"It's a good product (only been 1 week though, will update later on). Looks good. Works well. Sleek, light weight.  Following are some nit-picking from the initial experience: Not easily accessible ports (These are behind screen; hidden).It could have been way better if these would have been on the side. The stand is good looking, but not practical. It's not height adjustable."

33720,1,Recently my hp monitor fall down from table and crack in display. When I take it to hp service center they saying whatever problem u can return that and get new one and quoted price more than online price. So the point is if u struck in any problem.

34021,4,"Nice Monitor, no problem."
34022,4,Nice product.. must buy...
34023,5,"Excellent product in budget .i m loving it.i prefer this for who is finding home theater for his L.E.D ,laptop or computer ,"
34024,4,Its good in this price range but if you are looking for a high definition sound clarity so this is not for you and as of its cost it is best as per my opinion. one thing more bluetooth range is only 5 to 6 mts so keep this in mind before choosing this.
34025,5,Nice product. Bluetooth connectivity are very good and long distance. This speaker is suitable for small rooms in very nice experience. In this price very best quality. Very small product but sounds unbelievable. Sound very clear and good. 1 sub woofer 15 w 4 satellite speakers √ó 10 w = 4 w So Total 55 w 4.1 HOME THEATRE SYSTEM
34026,5,Completely mind blowing speaker more than my expectations and pocket friendly I'm very satisfied with the sound quality.... Very good all features work perfectly and fluent..!!
34027,4,"Writing this review after using 4 days.. No doubt its best sound system under this price segment. Let me tell u first, over all in this price segment this intex 4.1 channel home theater is super good. Really impressed with the sound üîä quality and Bass is very high. What more can u expect at this price. After all its brand intex. Over all you can buy this product with no doubt. You will get all necessary features.  CONNECTIVITY FEATURES ***  Bluetooth (10 m. Rang) Aux cable (you can connec..."
34028,5,Brilliant excellent performance thank you Flipkart I am use 10 days super product
34029,3,An average product which gives a decent output. Dont expect above average. As i also have a Intex 4.1 which is a old one bought before 10 years which is producing a good bass and sound output. But this product is just like a speaker box.. If u want a normal speaker with a minimal bass go for it. If u want a home theater effect dont go for it. While taking the price into consideration the speaker is good for the amount.
34030,3,"Good product valuable for money I like it, if u selecting for a better quality home theater under cheapest rate I preferd for u this b/s it's good and good quality one"
34031,4,Best buy in low budget. Sound quality is not that great however sound clarity is pretty good. I recommend to put some more money and get a good quality sound system if you are a music lover. It's good for people with low budget who are ok with so so sound system clarity. The material used is low quality so eventually you have to replace your system may be in a year or two. All functions mentions work perfectly fine. Good for your bedroom. Not recommended for living room.
34032,5,Nice product. Nice sound. The advantage is it have led light and 4 speaker

Simply what you are getting with this product is Just a brand name of Intex and ok ok type product.

37524,1,"First of all I am not recommending to buy this item due to following reasons:  1) Even though it is having 4 antennas, the range, I mean the strength of the Wifi signal is very much less than that of Netgear / TP Link routers with single antenna.  2) Most of the tools or features in the MiWifi app are not working.  3) Connectivity details are in China Language as usual.  4) It is very difficult to search for a password. Since No where it is mentioned.  5) Very difficult to mount on the wall. ..."
37525,5,"Smart features,looks is also impressive and app optimization is so good I like the overall extraordinary product."
37526,5,Good value for money product  Range-good  Speed - If your connection below 100 mbps so that it's good for you. But if you have more than 100 mbps connection so better you choose a dual band(5ghz) router
37527,1,Genuinely MI products are good and I am using all the products of Mi And I need to say about the MI router is after 2 weeks of usage is suddenly shut down and it is not even blinking the lights on top of Mi router I have seen a big issue with this MI router and I want to suggest you people to take the other best companies for your router I am saying genuinely to you all you have buying to take this product From Hyderabad Alwal
37528,4,These Router is just awesome.. I have used Mi Router 3c and now i ordered this one 4c.. This one is just an upgrade to the other one. But it works fine.. Not a single.issue till now using 3c from about a year and 6 months.. Using thia one from past 3 days the speed is good as per my plan no problems with any connections.. Look is also good but the thing which stops me to buy is the Company which is basically a chinese brand.. This is my last thing which i will be purchasing that is made in ch...
37529,3,"Just like a normal router, works well and as expected but nothing special.  It has those basic features as of all routes which includes :- 1. Bandwidth Control for some devices 2. Hiding the network SSID 3. Total data monitoring   However, even thought it as 4 antennas, the range is very low (I am not running it on 5 GHz otherwise it will be much lower). When I go onto rooftop (just above my room) the signal drops and only 1 bar of signal is available. Not to mention it only covers the place ..."
37530,5,Very good connectivity and range a bit less tried sign strength is good but if you go far about 10m it wouldn't give good signals. And app connectivity is easy to manage new and guest accounts. Overall a satisfied purchase from flipkart. And it's not a dual band wifi it's operates on 2.4 GHz band.
37531,5,Best Router in this segment...Go for it üëç Better than other brands like TP Link or D-Link. This router has various features and attractive sleek design with matte looks which wins your heart at first look. And 4 high gain antennas are outstanding...It covers my 3 BHK easily. Easy to use and beat thing is that you can easily access this from your phone... loaded with features.  In layman language...This router easily sync with your day-to-day life.  Thanks.
37532,5,GOOD PRODUCT & SOME CONS  MIWIFI QUALITY IS SUPER SOLID PERFORMANCE IS ALSO BEST AT THIS PRICE SEGMENT ROUTER HAS NEW FEATURE CALLED SIGNAL WALL PENETRATE MODE ALSO YOU CAN WIFI CONTROL APP (MIWIFI) FROM GOOGLE PLAY STORE BUT ONLY I HAVE ONE ISSUE [CHINESE PRODUCTS MOSTLY SPYING YOUR DATA SO MAYBE IT'S ALSO SPYING OR NOT ]
37533,5,Best router at this price range. It's very compact and lightweight. Though it's wi-fi range is not of some 4 antenna router still it's pretty good compared to other routers at this price range.
37534,5,Its a superb router to have......but remember one thing dont purchase this router by looking into the 4 antennas...!! Its a router worthy of range what u get from 2 antennas only. Its a good router u have app support as well. Very good interface u can easily check if any unwanted one is using ur router. Good to have .....go for it .... Vfm (value for money) for sure ..!!
37535,4,Nice Product........ It's an amazing product which is having 4 antennas for giving a wider range of connectivity.And it is an absolute SMART ROUTER which has the option of getting the details of all the connected devices.You can also set the daily data quota which will save your data if you are having a limited data plan from your ISP.  You can additionally connect up to 64 devices at a time without losing any speed.  The range is not so good as I have expected.... It is not giving an adequat...
37536,5,Wonderful purchase!!! üòÉüòÉ The best product at this price... There is no router at this price this good... Lookswise also very sleek and elegant ‚ù§‚ù§ very happy! Must buy!!! üíï
37537,5,It's really awesome products nice design with good inbuilt feature makes it a pro level WiFi router as I have at the moment 2 system working as we are working from home also 6 other mobiles are connected but I am getting a good speed to all the connections.
37538,3,Range is not good else ok..its good only for 1 bhk but you have to place in center then u will get proper connectivity
37539,3,4 antennas do not actually make any difference in reality..router is good but quality of signal gets generated in not that strong...when it comes to penetrate 3 walls it failed to show the power..works better with mi devices like phones or laptop compares to others...does not have a signal quality selector like only n or b/g/n
37540,2,The product is a really good product from Mi as it doesn't take much time to setup and minimum technical skill would be required to set this thing up...it is also easy to use by tha app and gives you full control over the device. A smart router in true sense.  Now after this why have I gave this 2 star...simple only one reason the packaging that I have got today and about this I won't write in details over here but rather I am sharing 2 photos which will be enough
37541,5,"most trusted band router with excellent product and work smoothly through MI WIFI app. thank flipkart and thank MI band ,nice looking and performing product ,I recommend all router user in INDIA to use mi router .Thank You."
37542,5,"I am writing this review after one month of uses of the another great product from xiomi... First of all the interface of the app to access the router is very simple.. keep is mind if you need more than 2 lan port this product is surely not for you, otherwise blindly go for it... If you have big house like me then it is the best router you can get to cover all the rooms.."
37543,4,Great router. Just don't think that because of the 4 sticks it is gonna have exceptional range. Good product for its price.
37544,5,Love the product....not so good built quality ..but works very well and that too at very reasonable price
37545,5,Product was excellent the speed for. Playing youtube is awesome n we can connect upto 64 devices new device notification is also available n bandwidth speed is also set by ours
37546,1,Not enough signal
37547,5,"Using this as a Wireless Repeater. Working perfectly. No issues. Very few Setup steps, which is extremely helpful."
37548,5,"Edit: Problem solved after replacing the ISP modem provided by local ISP.  Old review:Have lots of features but there is no stability in the connection, but actual broadband connection is stable! Also wifi connects and disconnects frequently."
37549,5,Best
37550,1,I purchased this router to extend JIOFI range but JIOFY itself provides far better coverage than this router. There is no refund option so I think I wasted my hard earned money :(
37551,2,"It's just good for 1BHK flat, beyond that you get very poor range"
37552,5,Router is very good...and the delivery man is very fast nd niceüòä
37553,4,Good
37554,5,Great
37555,3,Everything is fine but many time in a day data automatically disconnected.. don't know why... I m getting frustrated.. with this product

37563,1,"Pls don't buy MI ROUTER. it's a very bad router. Maximum 10 miter are covered. It's very worst router. I thik TP link is much better. So, don't buy. After all it's have no refund policy. Only replacement policy."
37564,5,Nice product
37565,5,Excellent Router from Mi in this price point. I asked few broadband technician about the product they said perfect router for home to office work.
37566,1,Worest router it's range is upto a single bedroom my Digisol single antena router is better than this one.Dont waste your money i returned it and return policy also very tough very very low range i think it is waste to have 4 antena single antena router is best than this one..
37567,3,Good Router having rich user interface alongwith mobile application. But does not meet my expectations. Some drawbacks are:-- 1. Range is not good in coparision to Dlink DIR-615 2. Does not assign static IP to router in Reapeater Mode(Wired or wireless)
37568,5,Nice!Nice Boostin&High Speed
37569,5,Best route in this Prince
37570,5,Supperb
37571,1,"It's bad. It don't give range. My friend and me took it 2 router together. Both router are bad. We have a plan of 5mbps, but it give20 kbps speed. West of money"
37572,1,The range of this router is low 5 mtr
37573,1,Worst product not working :-(
37574,4,"Range is poor, rest everything is fantastic! I keep almost 8-9 device connected and all work flawless.  Since the range is less, keep it somewhere where it can send signals throughout the flat.  Hardware needs improvement, Software is best that nobody else gives."
37575,5,Good
37576,5,Nice ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç‚ò∫Ô∏è
37577,3,"I am using this as a repeater.. pros: 1. smart looks 2.easy configuration 3. wifi range is good but had more expectation as it has 4 antennas. Cons: 1.sometimes too much packet loss 20% to 50%.Then it become very irritating while online gaming. 2.features are limited in repeater mode. 3.speed decreases up to 30% 4.It has a heating issue,but acceptable. 5.hardware is not the best  With a little more money you can get a better router of dilnk or tplink..."
37578,5,Superb performance

Pros The device looks sleep and can be kept in any room without spoiling the look of the room. Easy to set up and connect The interface is awesome and can be easily used.  Cons Even with 4 antennas the range is bad."
37617,5,The product is good. It delivers high speed internet. The actual range is around 30-40 metres. One can go for this product in this prize range as this is superior among the all in this price range Easy to use Run through miwifi app.
37618,5,Awesome product ...Worth per penny..Love it.. Really loved it

37632,4,Nice product
37633,2,Used this for almost a month. If you are spending 1K to get this. Would recommend to get a DLink for 1.5k. Because this MI router will give you high ping. Low wifi coverage. The connection will break if you are in a different room. In case you have a old build property then the scenerio would get even worse.
37634,5,Very good product no issue of coverage i don't know why everyone is complaining about the range i live on 3rd floor and the network reaches the ground floor too . Very satisfied
37635,5,Good on this price range.
37636,5,Router is exceptional.. Every one complaining about range but it is working gem for me as it is covering entire my house with full signal and even down floor with 3points.... Thank you flipkart for speedy delivery and delivering me orginal product

37982,5,It's a good product from xiaomi. AboutAbout 30 metre range I'm impressed
37983,2,The product is extremely difficult to mount. As it can only be placed on a table. Signal strength won't be good enough if you expect signals in one room with the router in another. Don't go for it.
37984,3,Signal strength is so weak .
37985,5,Good üëç ü•∞300mps speed

38193,4,Easy to configure and good coverage for a small house.  Compare to other devices it gave me hassle free configuration and moreover it's easy to install. Also the wire connector is big enough to keep distance.  However if you are looking for high speed more then 100mbps and bigger house then this would not fullfil your requirements.
38194,1,Wi-Fi low range
38195,4,NB :. It is a router not a modem.. It is only used to extend the connection and increase the coverage and speed  Don't underestimate it is the only thing needed for a broadband connection . A modem is also needed.
38196,2,The range is not working at all. Even doesn't reach ground floor from first floor.
38197,1,Don't purchase. Wifi range is too bad. After 6 month . Wifi Problems start . Download speed 400kbps on wifi. I have 100mbps plan on Airtel fiber .
38198,3,I'm using it as a wifi extender.. It serves the purpose
38199,5,Nice

38259,3,"Suitable only for small or medium House single storage house best for 1,2bhk house."
38260,5,Best router in the budget. Easiest installation ever. This is an honest review as used this router more than a year.
38261,5,Very Good Products and Weight is very Low..
38262,1,Reng very bad
38263,3,Very nice product but the frequency of the router is decreasing day by day
38264,1,network not proper
38265,3,im not recommded this router for more than 1000sqft area.signal strength is average.you can increase signal strenth by applying silver foil.miwifi app is really excellent. it can fully access to all devices connected to your wifi you can also set speed limit for specific devices.
38266,5,Nice
38267,5,Best in class
38268,5,Thanks üòä
38269,5,Awasome
38270,5,Super
38271,4,Awesome
38272,3,"For Home use its okk..But if u r thinking for office use plz go for another product..response time is very slow, by the way looks and design is good.. overall average product"
38273,4,Good
38274,4,Great product but there is no wps button and there is not hole so that we can hang it to the wall for this reason i have given it four star ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê other than that no problem
38275,5,Easy to Install and Faster Download
38276,3,Range is low
38277,4,Nice
38278,5,Good
38279,1,"Useless product, not working properly, not giving full signal in 3 meter range."
38280,5,nice
38281,5,Good product
38282,1,Raise your money üí∞ so bad
38283,5,Nice product
38284,2,Very bad range. Four antenna attracts to purchase at that price. But performance is not even equal to some other two antenna router's. I regret this purchase üòè
38285,1,Ping is very worst
38286,1,Very very bad . don't by this router
38287,4,The Product Received on time and it was very good It was the value for money...!!
38288,2,Poor range Speed is also average. Go for some other options like tenda or D-Link
38289,4,Very good product. Working so fast.
38290,5,Good in signal üì∂strength
38291,5,Nice üëç product
38292,1,That product is very bad connectivity is very poor I am not recommended to buy . product only 10 days is not working .my rating is zero
38293,1,Faltu product
38294,3,Looks wise it's quite good. But the main reason for which anyone would buy this i.e. using the wifi the experience is not so good. Despite of having four antennas I'm not sure why it's range is not so good. It should be okay for two rooms. But beyond that one should not consider this.
38295,5,Very good product
38296,5,BEST IN CLASS.....................!
38297,5,It's very Nice and very Good Connectivity
38298,4,"average coverage,network speed distribution is awesome.....Thats all.."
38299,1,Range problem
38300,1,Poor signal quality
38301,4,I can give 4 star coz rage very good compared to D-Link. If u all have 2 BHK then this is very good for coverage even in washroom... Build is ok ok.. And very slim looks suprb Con:- Wire is too short... Two lane port
38302,1,Wrost router I have ever used. 50 Mbps connection but speed from router doesn't go beyond 10 Mbps. I suggest you all to do not buy this. It will waste your money. Even the response of company is also very very bad.
38303,1,Range gets dropping down in every month I'm using 100mps speed this router is not proving the range on this Totally un satisfied with the product...
38304,2,Range of 4 antena is too low as 1antenaüôÑ
38305,5,I can believe on mi after closing eyes.really it is nice product..
38306,5,Good
38307,3,Range is not up to the mark As accepted
38308,5,Very good
38309,5,Nice product
38310,3,Range is not as expected Only 15 meters range *in home I think this 4 antenna is not performing only one is active
38311,3,"I expect more range... But it provides almost every same range like tp-link, D-Link as this price range, otherwise it's a Good option.."
38312,5,Nice
38313,1,Wi-Fi Connecting problem auto Disconnecting and connect again after 2 min. I'm return this product.
38314,5,One of the best wifi router at affordable price
38315,5,Wow nice product...

38318,1,Very bad experience!!!
38319,5,Good
38320,3,Good product
38321,5,The best router in this price range. This is my second purchase and this time it is being used as a repeater. The setup is very simple and intuitive. Only thing I hope is addition of 5Ghz in the next upgrade at this price point.
38322,1,It's is very bad product not working properly
38323,5,Excellent
38324,3,working well
38325,5,Amazing product..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
38326,5,Awesome product in price..
38327,3,Good ‚ò∫Ô∏è c
38328,5,It's a nice product.
38329,5,I've been using it for 1 month. Best product in market. *value for price *good range *more than enough speed(after using it as a secondary router too) *the web portal is very much user friendly. *one tap convert... (as a router or repeater(wireless and wired) through the mobile app).  ** the mobile app actually does nothing but starts the connectivity.  After all.. You can buy the product if you get it under 1k.
38330,2,Network coverage is too bad.
38331,1,Terrible purchase Used 1day but wifi range is horrible even speed is too not good. 4 antenas not working and covering i think
38332,4,Bohut acha hai nice warking ü§óü§óü§óü§ó
38333,5,The Best
38334,1,It didn't work only when tried before installation ....
38335,1,"Worst product. Mi router 3C was much better than this. Range of this router is not good when compared to the Mi 3C router. Mi 3C router has the advantage of running on powerbank but not 4C. If you are looking for good range, this one is not for you. Go for Tenda N301 or TP-Link 841N if your budget is around thousand rupees."
38336,5,Very easy to configure. Nice speed. Nice looking device from MI. Thanks Flipkart for awesome delivery experience
38337,1,Very poor poor range even my house is small but range doesn't cross even 10ft üò°üò°i used only 1 day
38338,1,Previously i was using mi router 3c it has good coverage This 4c model doesn't give even half of the strength of old router Really disappointing worse than mobile hotspot
38339,4,I like it but only two lan port
38340,3,An average router. Don't buy it if you are looking for high range.
38341,5,It's perfectly worked üòÑ

38361,5,Amazing
38362,1,Range not properly my flat 2bhk didn't network issue
38363,5,Pole item super net
38364,5,I love this product.. product price is very good as compared to other router.. but one demerit i have notice that tha range of MI router is too short.. overall product is very good .. but range of a router is not suitable for long distance around 450sq.ft.
38365,1,It is a damaged product
38366,5,The shipment was nice
38367,4,"4 antenna is just overkill, it isn't any better than tp link or D-Link 2 antenna models. The best part of this router is its software. Very useful and use to use."
38368,5,Super router very easy setup n good speed
38369,5,Mesmerizing.
38370,5,good product
38371,5,All good but range is low
38372,4,"Good product, I am using it as repeater for enhancing the existing wifi signals into the non covered area of my house. Good product. Very simple to setup through its mi wifi app."
38373,4,I thought my girlfriend is the best thing but this wifi proved me wrong
38374,2,Coverage is very bad... those 4 anntenas of no useüëéüèº
38375,5,Value for money
38376,4,Good speed. Narrow range.
38377,3,Too good. But its china product.
38378,2,The range of the WiFi is not at all good. If you want to use it in 2 small rooms nearby then only it's good. Else go for something else.
38379,2,Don't buy this speed and range not good.Buy more trusted brands like Tplink and D-Link.My D-Link router covers almost half of home but this router can't even a single room.
38380,5,Good Product
38381,4,Good
38382,3,It's good
38383,2,Ok ok type route..

38402,1,Not good as previous mi3 c router
38403,5,Vvv good
38404,5,Awesome product it's working absolutely fine
38405,5,Nice flipkart
38406,4,"Light weight. No hook holes to hang. Four antennas are good. Minimal design. One main Lan port, two child Lan ports."
38407,1,Worst product ever
38408,5,Delivery man was too awesome üëçüëèüëèüëè thanks flipkart
38409,2,Not good range sometimes disconnect network
38410,3,"Good at this price range, single band(2.4 gHz).The router has 4 antenna, but they are for showing, range is good for small room. I even can't get signal at ground floor, my router is placed at 1st floor. Good for this price point."
38411,1,I bought this router last week firstly I felt that some technical issues should happened but after 1week also same problem happened with me again and again don‚Äôt buy this it won‚Äôt cover a single floor also very bad coverage.
38412,1,Very poor signal range.
38413,1,Very bad router .
38414,5,Best quality nice to work
38415,5,Best product
38416,4,"Hanged at a place were it can reach my complete home, product is very light and powerful and easy to install. We can control it by using Mi WiFi app"
38417,5,Good Product
38418,4,Thanks filpkart
38419,1,Very poor range. Highly disappointed with the performance. I was using tenda and d-link routers(both having single antenna) before opting for this router. I was expecting a big boost on the range but after using it i am shocked to see the poor reception. I‚Äôll strictly not recommend this router to anyone mainly cos of its poor range
38420,3,Very low coverage. Better to go for TP link
38421,5,Ruff tum all jaan
38422,5,"Best router ,,, amazing experience with mi . It covers my all rooms and speed is superb and through mi wifi app its super duper cool and easy to connect ..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏èüëç"
38423,3,Overall an average Router! Good point: Very light weight Very nice design Easy to setup and manage through mobile app. Can be used as repeater.  Cons: Range is average even though it has 4 antennas. Less than my current router with 2 antennas. Have only 2 lan ports. Dont have a hole for hanging on wall. So you have to keep it on some surface.  More ports and a modem port for telephone line would have been added advantage but modem does not have it.  Overall a good average router. I use it as...
38424,5,This is very good quality product and my work is very well
38425,5,Excellent stability Excellent strength Low range coverage
38426,3,Good
38427,4,After usage of 4months. Its really nice product.
38428,3,"Good in terms of speed and fast connectivity, however the range is soo poor that am unable to connect it beyond 15 meters on any side even after making sure there are no signal interferences"
38429,5,Awesome
38430,4,Wi-Fi range is not satisfactory..
38431,5,Nice product. I have installed on ground floor and access internet on first floor as well.
38432,5,"Doesn't give much range, but good enough within a small range"
38433,4,It's good for home daily use.Easy to setup with a little tutorial.But if you have plans to connect your house having too many walls and obstructions it can be a little let down at the furthest point.Still the connectivity received is appreciable.Given the price point in which you get its more than your expectations.The app led monitoring feature is a real delight.
38434,1,The connectivity is not even there from 10metres of router whenever there is a power off the router doesn't connect with the internet it is not working properly can't even switch off the router
38435,5,Very Good Quality
38436,5,Very nice router. Worth buying it.
38437,4,"Heavy duty router , best of all 1 k range , performance peaks and lets see for how many months it will last"
38438,4,"Timely delivery. The product works good so far but it would be too early to say anything. I have a problem with the seller, as the product was sent without external packing. When I received parcel, the original box was wet and Mishandled."
38439,5,A smart product
38440,5,It is average
38441,1,Disgusting every time Wi-Fi was disconnecting and also Wi-Fi range was not good if range is below 3 nothing can work
38442,5,good item value for money
38443,3,Range is very limited go for other options.
38444,3,"Good, Range is not enough though"
38445,3,Distance is not as expected as it was..
38446,4,Good router but signal strength is not great.
38447,5,This wifi is very good
38448,4,Super iam Happy
38449,2,Worst product

38455,5,Great
38456,3,I am not satisfied But wifi range is good
38457,4,"Delivered at time. However, packing is below the mark."
38458,1,No wall penetration. Ridiculous range.
38459,5,I have been using for 3months so far no speed drop or anything to worry. Best Router in this price range.
38460,1,wifi range and strength is worst

38471,4,There is an issue with the router range. But it is good for a 2 bhk house. Very sleek and beautiful. But those 4 antennas are just for show I guess.

38473,5,excellent ;)
38474,5,Good
38475,5,Range is good User interface is very good compared to other companies

38477,2,"Range is not good even having 4 antenna. Also number of lan port is less. Adaptor makes noise like flying house fly in home .. giving two star only for built quality, their no hanging Hooks are there on back side so only you can place it on table top."

38490,1,Very bad rang
38491,3,Low in signal strength
38492,2,"Pros: Range is good Cons: it has been just one month and this particular router is showing no internet, where as others are working fine. Though reset is done the same is repeating. Need to get it replaced"
38493,5,I like the delivery as well as packaging of Flipkart and this product is awesome. Only I don't like it is Chinese and I don't get it any Indian product
38494,1,Not recommended stopper working in 2 months
38495,4,"Product is good .. but flip kart delivery is worst . I received this product after delivery date,,,bcoz I talked to their customers care many times they also said that today is your delivery date...but after 2 days I got it"

38574,3,"Overall the setting up of router is quite simple but if your broadband connection is giving 100mbps of speed through lan cable, than the router gives out only 50% of speed (i.e. 45 to 50mbps). Would expect xiaomi to look into this issue."

38937,1,The wifi range is really bad and the signal keeps fluctuating even if I'm near the router . Previously was using a tplink dual antenna which had better range than this router even though it has 4 antennas. PLEASE BUY A TP LINK OR A DLINK . DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT
38938,1,Utterly disappointed Worst router I have bought. Has issue in it . Frequently loses wifi signal . Can't connect to it . Only after restarting it works again . This problem happens 4-5 times everyday . Very much disappointed . Problem started after just 2 months. Also signal range is not that great. Should have bought other router. Made a mistake.

I have been using it from one week, I haven't disconnected to internet yet, my past router I used to disconnect minimum once in a day, liked it totally.

Serving me for 2 floors with one 3 BHK flat in each floor ->3 lan ports -> Can be easily setup just by seeing the manual not even required to check the CD  Cons: ->Can't be moun..."
38954,4,The Good Is Worth Its Value. Happy to Have this Router with pretty Fast delivery. Purpose accomplished without hassle. In Market At Home.Covers considerable area and i shall recommend everyone who is willing to buy Router for home/ office use. So far undoubtedly doubtless product.
38955,4,works fine with the 300mbps connection. sometimes it needs a re-start after a few days. and it's good to go. range it not too much but it's good for a small apartment or flat. not suitable for an office or whole floor.
38956,5,"Best in its price segment feels more durable and rugged than Mi 3c router although not lighter than it. Wifi range is good,connectivity is fast and wifi management is simple(configuration wise) . *Don't buy a separate lan cable it comes with one already. It is Universal Repeater. You can easily set-up this router as a universal repeater to extend your wireless network's coverage. It router esay setup. I bought rs. 799/-, good router"
38957,5,"I'm using this from May 2020. It is working like a charm. I have 3 storeys building, it gives full coverage on 1st floor on which router is kept but on ground and top floor it gives 75% coverage which is best for me. I have connected two smart tvs and 7-10 smart phones. All works smoothly on Alliance fiber connection. I bought this at Rs.799 which is very much reasonable and best at this range. If you're planning for a router then go for it."
38958,4,"Good enough for 2 BHK and has good range i guess up to 40 meters i guessüëç, i have been using it for almost 2 weeks now and it's pretty good no issues till now, the setting up was easy as in the manual, the speed is also great üëçüëå"
38959,5,"When you search for Routers online, you have so many options available with so many different price tags. Also you are sceptical whether you should buy them online or not, fearing the workability. But I can tell you one thing with assurance that this product is excellent. Be it the simplicity in the looks, workability, long term usage and durability. And yeah! its working still fine after more than 1 year of usage."
38960,5,2.5 GHz Router Best Feature is you can monitor and control speed for each device connected to WiFi. Easy Setup. Extremely Happy with performance of the product. Option to block sites is also available May be useful for parents.

I had used another dual band wifi router, that had the setting option for changing bands either. This product is only having dual antenna but not the dual band selection option.

39597,5,Good
39598,4,perfect it was friendly to use
39599,1,It's just a basic router whose range is very low and not at all satisfied with the product and service of flipkart.

39610,5,Good
39611,5,It is a very good purchase. I can use 3 phone 2 laptops and one Android TV at once connecting with it and didn't face connectivity issue or internet speed drop. I use a 50 MBPS package. And surprisingly I receive 50 MBPS for all devices . It doesn't even split the speed. Also the range is very high. It covers almost 2300 Sq ft area
39612,5,Very nice üòäüòä product

39643,5,"Doing well, range is good.."
39644,5,Best product
39645,4,"Easy to install,good range ,getting speed upto 10mbps according to my net plan."
39646,4,As of now router is working fine but some time there is connectivity issue i guess it was due to local provider end.
39647,3,Easy to use
39648,2,There is a significant drop in the signal strength. A 30mbps connection gives only 5-8mbps throught this router but over 30mbps over Lan cable. The signal strength also drops after 5-8ft making it useless even for a 2bhk.
39649,5,I love this router .......................................

39660,5,Thank you Flipkart and seller for this very good budget router. Delivery was on time before one day of they have mentioned.  Full star for the product but packaging was poor. It came with only its original box. It should have protective cover or a protective box.  I like this product for It's very easy setup method. It auto detects our internet broadband connection type and recommend us with right type. (Correct type of broadband connection).  It has not Switch for on/off.  It doesn't suppor...

39690,1,Very poor product
39691,4,Good product
39692,4,Good wifi range
39693,4,It's Made In China. Otherwise it is great router with minimalist interface and range is good according to 2 antennas it will be worth it. You will face no loss till 5m after that it deteriorates and last you can get range upto 15-20 m radius that will be enough. Using it in the centre point of your house and you are good to go. Well I used it as a repeater it is extending main wifi's signal fully.  2.4GHz is the only mode for repeater too. Those who don't know Don't think that you will repeat...
39694,3,Ok working but signal not proper
39695,5,Worthy product
39696,5,Super. Excellent wifi distribution. Very easy installation.
39697,5,Nice Full of range
39698,5,Good one
39699,4,"After using almost 5 month I can say it one of the best router available .. It can penetrate 3 wall which is 5 inch , 10 inch , and 5 inch of thickness respectively with 40% signal strength .. and free space range is almost 50meter with 50% signal strength. If you place the router center of your house it can cover easily a 3bhk flat easily and can provide signal in 2 floor without any fluctuations.. In short just buy it..."
